## God's Love of Justice

**Overarching Theme:** Vindicating God's Character: Reflecting His Changeless Love and Justice in the Final Conflict
**Central Focus:** Understanding that God's perfect, unchanging character of love *and* justice is the foundation of His government, and our calling is to perfectly reflect this character through His power, thus vindicating Him before the universe as the final conflict closes.
**Key Texts:** Jeremiah 9:24, Psalm 89:14, Matthew 5:48, Revelation 15:3-4

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

**I. Introduction (5-7 mins)**
    *   Hook: "How can a God of perfect love also be a God of perfect justice, especially when we see so much suffering and evil? How do these two seemingly opposite traits work together?"
    *   Theme Introduction: Today we explore a profound truth: God's character, a perfect blend of love AND justice, is unchanging. Understanding this is key to knowing Him, and our highest calling is to reflect this character, especially now.
        *   *(Whiteboard: Write Main Theme Title: Vindicating God's Character: Reflecting His Changeless Love & Justice)*
    *   Connection to Character/Eternity: This isn't just theology; it's about our sanctification. Reflecting His character is the evidence of true conversion and essential preparation for Christ's soon return and eternity with Him.
    *   Roadmap: We'll examine (1) The Foundation: God's inseparable Love and Justice, (2) The Mandate: Our call to reflect His perfection, and (3) The Vindication: Why this matters supremely in the Great Controversy.

**II. The Foundation: God's Changeless Character of Love AND Justice (10-12 mins)**
    *   **A. Love and Justice: Inseparable Pillars of His Throne:**
        *   Core Teaching Point: God's love doesn't negate His justice, nor does His justice diminish His love. They are two sides of the same perfect, holy character – the very foundation of His eternal government.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Psalm 89:14 - "Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; Mercy (lovingkindness) and truth go before Your face." Jeremiah 9:24 - Knowing God means understanding He *exercises* lovingkindness, judgment, *and* righteousness. He delights in *all* these.
        *   EGW Insight: "Justice is the foundation of His throne, and the fruit of His love. It had been Satan's purpose to divorce mercy from truth and justice... But Christ shows that in God's plan they are indissolubly joined together; the one cannot exist without the other." (DA 762.2).
        *   Application/Problem Tackled: Addresses the misconception (often fueled by Satan, see SC 10-11) that God is either *only* loving (ignoring sin) or *only* just (harsh/severe). We must grasp the perfect balance.

    *   **B. Changeless Principles, Relational Responses:** [*]
        *   Core Teaching Point: God's *moral character* and *principles* are absolutely changeless (Mal 3:6, James 1:17). His described "relenting" (Ex 32:14) isn't a change in His character, but a change in His *action* based on His unchanging principles of mercy and justice, often in response to human repentance or intercession.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Numbers 23:19 ("God is not a man, that He should lie, nor a son of man, that He should repent.") contrasts with Exodus 32:14 ("So the LORD relented..."). This shows His faithfulness to His covenant promises and warnings – He responds according to the conditions met or unmet.
        *   EGW Insight: Moses understood God's "Let Me alone" not as final, but as an invitation to intercede, appealing to God's own character and promises (PP 318-319). God relents from judgment *because* He is merciful and just, when conditions allow.
        *   Application/Obstacles to Depth: Helps overcome confusion about seemingly contradictory texts. God's responses are consistent with His unchanging character, not arbitrary whims.

    *   ***Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2):***
        *   *Analogy:* Imagine a perfectly balanced scale. On one side is God's infinite Love (Hesed - covenant faithfulness), on the other His perfect Justice (Mishpat). His actions always keep this scale perfectly balanced. Removing one destroys the integrity of the other.
        *   *Hypothetical:* A wise and loving king establishes fair laws for his kingdom (justice). When his own son breaks a law deserving punishment, the king's love motivates him to find a way to satisfy justice (perhaps paying the penalty himself) while still offering forgiveness and restoration, upholding the law's integrity. His *actions* respond to the situation, but his *character* (loving justice) remains constant.

        *   *Quote Snippet:* "...foundation of His throne." (DA 762.2) / "...indissolubly joined..." (DA 762.2)

    *   ***Discussion Questions (Allow brief time):***
        *   *(Simple/Observation):* "In Psalm 89:14, what two things are called the foundation of God's throne?"
        *   *(Reflection):* "Why is it dangerous to emphasize God's love *without* His justice, or His justice *without* His love?"
        *   *(Application):* "How does knowing God's character is perfectly balanced and unchanging give you confidence, even when facing difficulties?"

**III. The Mandate: Reflecting God's Perfect Character (10-12 mins)**
    *   **A. The High Calling to Perfection:**
        *   Core Teaching Point: We are called to reflect God's complete character – His goodness, love, mercy, *and* justice. This isn't about achieving sinlessness in our own strength, but about surrendering fully to Christ so His perfect character can be reproduced in us.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Matthew 5:48 - "Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect." This follows the command to love even enemies (v. 44-45), showing perfection involves reflecting God's impartial love and goodness. Deut 32:4 - "He is the Rock, His work is perfect; For all His ways are justice, A God of truth and without injustice; Righteous and upright is He." Our standard is God Himself.
        *   EGW Insight: "The shortness of time is urged as an incentive... This is not the great motive... Jesus is attractive. He is full of love, mercy, and compassion... He proposes to elevate to companionship with Himself those who come to Him..." (TMK 320.2). It's about relationship and transformation, not just fear.
        *   Application/Problem Tackled: Addresses feelings of inadequacy or the tendency towards legalism. Perfection is Christ *in* us, the hope of glory (Col 1:27), achieved through constant connection and surrender.

    *   **B. Refined Through Trials for His Likeness:** [*]
        *   Core Teaching Point: Difficulties and trials are not signs of God's disapproval but are often His chosen instruments to purify our character and deepen our reflection of Him, burning away the dross so His image shines clearer.
        *   Biblical Foundation: James 1:2-4 - "Count it all joy when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing." 1 Peter 1:7 - Trials prove the genuineness of faith, like gold tested by fire.
        *   EGW Insight: We need more than theoretical knowledge. "Experience is knowledge derived from experiment... ‘Taste and see that the Lord is good.’... They have never tasted and learned by experience that the Lord is good." (T5 221.2-3). Trials provide opportunities to experience His faithfulness and grow.
        *   Application/Character Trait Focus: Trials develop patience, endurance, deeper faith, humility, and reliance on God – key aspects of Christ's character needed for the final days.

    *   ***Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2):***
        *   *Visual Metaphor:* Like a silversmith refining silver. He heats the metal intensely (trials) to bring impurities (sin, selfishness) to the surface so they can be skimmed off. He knows the process is complete when he can see his own reflection clearly in the purified silver. God allows trials to refine us until Christ's image is reflected.
        *   *Analogy:* An apprentice sculptor learning from the Master. The Master chips away rough edges, smooths surfaces, sometimes using forceful blows (trials), sometimes gentle polishing (blessings), all to reveal the beautiful form hidden within the stone – conforming us to the image of Christ.

        *   *Verse:* Matt 5:48 / James 1:2-4
        *   *Question:* How are trials refining tools?

    *   ***Discussion Questions (Allow brief time):***
        *   *(Simple/Recall):* "What does James 1 say the testing of our faith produces?" OR "What was the silversmith analogy illustrating?"
        *   *(Reflection):* "How does the command 'Be perfect' feel different when we understand it means reflecting Christ *through His power* rather than achieving it ourselves?"
        *   *(Application):* "When facing a trial this week, how can remembering its potential refining purpose (James 1:4) change our response?"

**IV. The Vindication: Why Reflecting His Character Matters Now [*] (8-10 mins)**
    *   **A. Demonstrating God's Justice Before the Universe:**
        *   Core Teaching Point: In the Great Controversy, Satan has accused God of being unjust and His law impossible to keep. God's final generation, by reflecting His character of love and justice through His power, will vindicate God's name and prove Satan a liar.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Revelation 15:3-4 - The redeemed sing, "Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God Almighty! Just and true are Your ways, O King of the saints! Who shall not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name? ... For Your judgments have been manifested." Our lives contribute to this final manifestation. Micah 6:8 - "Do justly, love mercy, walk humbly" – this reflects God's character and is His requirement.
        *   EGW Insight: "God's goodness is to be made known. ‘Ye are My witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God.’ Isaiah 43:12." (COL 299.1). Our lives are testimonies in the cosmic conflict.
        *   Application/End-Time Relevance: Our daily choices to act justly, love mercy, and depend on God are not small things; they are part of the final demonstration of God's character needed before Christ returns.

    *   **B. Readiness for His Appearing:**
        *   Core Teaching Point: Reflecting God's character is the ultimate readiness for His return. It's not just about doctrinal knowledge, but about a heart transformed into His likeness, prepared to live eternally in His presence where only holiness can dwell.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Hebrews 12:14 - "Pursue peace with all people, and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord." Titus 2:11-14 - God's grace teaches us to live soberly, righteously, and godly... zealous for good works, awaiting His appearing.
        *   EGW Insight: Those who heed the warnings of coming judgment, like Noah and Lot, and align their lives with God's will through faith, are saved (DA 634). Our preparation involves acting on faith and obedience now.
        *   Application/Need & Solution: The need is transformation. The solution is daily surrender to Christ, allowing the Holy Spirit to work His character in us (LHU 253.6).

    *   ***Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2):***
        *   *Analogy:* Ambassadors in a hostile foreign territory. Their conduct, integrity, and representation of their King's just and merciful laws either honor or dishonor their homeland. We are Christ's ambassadors (2 Cor 5:20) in enemy territory.
        *   *Hypothetical Courtroom Drama:* Imagine God on trial before the universe, accused by Satan. Who are the key witnesses for the defense? His people, whose transformed lives demonstrate the goodness, justice, and power of God's character and law.

        *   *Quote Snippet:* "Ye are My witnesses..." (COL 299.1)

    *   ***Discussion Questions (Allow brief time):***
        *   *(Simple/Observation):* "According to Revelation 15, what do the redeemed declare about God's ways?"
        *   *(Reflection):* "How does viewing our daily character development as part of 'vindicating God' change its importance?"
        *   *(Application):* "What is one specific area where we can be more intentional this week about 'doing justly' or 'loving mercy' (Micah 6:8) in our interactions?"

**V. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)**
    *   Summary: We've seen that God's character is a perfect, unchanging blend of love and justice. Knowing Him means understanding this balance. Our highest calling, especially now, is to surrender fully so He can reproduce this beautiful character in us.
    *   Character Focus Recap: The call to "be perfect" (Matt 5:48) is a call to reflect His love *and* His justice, made possible only through His transforming grace. This is the essence of sanctification and readiness.
        *   *(Whiteboard: Key Character Trait: FAITHFULNESS / HOLINESS)*
    *   Call to Action/Decision: Don't be content with a superficial understanding or experience. Seek to know God deeply. Choose daily, hourly, to surrender your will, your thoughts, your actions to Him. Ask Him to refine you, to reflect His character through you.
        *   *(Whiteboard: Call to Action Keyword: SURRENDER / REFLECT / TRUST)*
        *   *(Optional Final Question):* "As we close, what one aspect of God's character – His love, His justice, His faithfulness – will you specifically ask Him to develop more fully in you this week?" (Lead into prayer)
    *   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: "There is a day just about to burst upon us when God's mysteries will be seen, and all His ways vindicated..." (TM 433.2). Let us cooperate with Him now, allowing His love and justice to transform us, that we may be ready and bring Him glory. He *is* coming soon!
        *   *(Whiteboard: Final Verse Ref or Hope phrase: Rev 22:12 / "He is Coming! Be Ready!")*
