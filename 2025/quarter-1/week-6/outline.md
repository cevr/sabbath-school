### Introduction (6 min)

*   **Opening Illustration**: Contrast the capricious, often cruel "gods" of the ancient Near East (or modern secular "gods" like power, wealth, self) with the God revealed in Scripture. Pagan deities demanded appeasement, often through horrific acts, offering no reliable favor (Deut. 32:17; 1 Cor. 10:20). Their character was unpredictable, immoral.
*   **The True God**: Yahweh is fundamentally different. His character is perfect goodness, unwavering justice, and infinite love. He is not fickle; His nature is constant (Mal. 3:6; James 1:17). This provides the only true foundation for hope.
*   **Memory Text (Jeremiah 9:24 NKJV)**: *"But let him who glories glory in this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am the LORD, exercising lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness in the earth. For in these I delight,' says the LORD.”*
    *   God doesn't glory in raw power or abstract sovereignty alone, but in His active moral attributes: *lovingkindness* (Hesed - covenant faithfulness, mercy), *judgment* (Mishpat - justice, making right what is wrong), and *righteousness* (Tzedakah - right conduct, integrity). He *delights* in these.
*   **Lesson Focus**: This week, we delve into the beautiful, inseparable nature of God's love and justice, His inherent goodness, and His unchanging character. Understanding *who* God is transforms *who* we become.
*   **Character Goal**: The ultimate aim of our existence is the restoration of God's image in us (Gen 1:27, Rom 8:29). Studying His character is paramount to reflecting it. "By beholding we become changed" (2 Cor 3:18).

### Sunday: Love and Justice (9 min)

*   **Central Point**: God's love and justice are not opposing forces but intertwined aspects of His perfect character and the foundation of His government. True love demands justice, and true justice is motivated by love.
*   **Biblical Foundation**:
    *   **Psalm 33:5**: "He loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of the steadfast love of the LORD." (Love *for* justice, flowing from His steadfast love).
    *   **Isaiah 61:8**: "For I the LORD love justice; I hate robbery and wrong..." (Active love for justice implies hatred for its opposite).
    *   **Psalm 89:14**: "Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; steadfast love and faithfulness go before you." (The very basis of His rule).
    *   **Psalm 85:10**: "Steadfast love and faithfulness meet; righteousness and peace kiss each other." (Harmony, not conflict, in God's attributes).
    *   **Micah 6:8**: "He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness [mercy], and to walk humbly with your God?" (Our required reflection of His character).
*   **Ellen G. White Insights**:
    *   "Justice is the foundation of His throne, and the fruit of His love." (DA 762.2). Love is the root, justice the necessary expression.
    *   "In God's plan they are indissolubly joined together; the one cannot exist without the other." (DA 762.2). Trying to separate them creates a distorted view of God.
    *   God "yearns over His erring children; in every way possible He seeks to teach them the way of life everlasting." His justice is tempered and guided by this yearning love (PK 414.1).
    *   "God will not tolerate injustice from man to his fellow-men. He will not pass over oppression and wrong." (RH, Oct 1, 1895). His love demands He act against injustice.
*   **Character Application**:
    *   **Problem**: Humanity perverts both love (making it selfish or permissive) and justice (making it harsh, vindictive, or self-serving). We often struggle to balance mercy and accountability.
    *   **Solution**: Understand that God's love *motivates* His justice. His justice *upholds* the principles necessary for love to flourish.
    *   **Implementation**: In our families, churches, and communities, how can we practice justice motivated by love? How do we show mercy without condoning sin? How do we hold others accountable with compassion? Reflecting God means embodying *both* love and justice. Cry out for God's perfect justice to ultimately prevail.

### Monday: God Is Entirely Good and Righteous (8 min)

*   **Central Point**: God doesn't just *do* good and righteous things; He *is* inherently good and righteous. His actions flow perfectly from His unchanging nature. There is no darkness or potential for evil within Him.
*   **Biblical Foundation**:
    *   **Deuteronomy 32:4**: "The Rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and upright is he." (Foundationally just and faithful).
    *   **Psalm 92:15**: "...the LORD is upright; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him." (Absolute absence of unrighteousness).
    *   **Zephaniah 3:5**: "The LORD within her is righteous; he does no injustice..." (Incapable of injustice).
    *   **Psalm 145:17**: "The LORD is righteous in all his ways and kind [holy] in all his works." (Consistent character across all actions).
    *   **1 John 1:5**: "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all." (Absolute purity and goodness).
    *   **James 1:13**: "...God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one." (Immune to evil).
    *   **Exodus 33:18-19**: Moses asks to see God's glory. God responds, "I will make all my *goodness* pass before you..." God's glory *is* His goodness, His character.
*   **Ellen G. White Insights**:
    *   "Jesus is attractive. He is full of love, mercy, and compassion. He proposes to be our friend..." (TMK 320.3). This attractiveness stems from His inherent goodness.
    *   We need "experimental religion." Don't just hear or read; "*Taste* and see that the Lord is good." Experience His goodness personally (5T 221.2-3).
    *   Satan pictures God as severe, emphasizing stern justice. Jesus came "to remove this dark shadow, by revealing to the world the infinite love [and inherent goodness] of God." (SC 11.1).
*   **Character Application**:
    *   **Problem**: Suffering and the existence of evil cause many to question God's goodness. How can a good God allow such things?
    *   **Solution**: Anchor faith in God's revealed character – He *is* good, even when circumstances seem to contradict it. His goodness is linked to His glory. The Great Controversy framework helps explain the temporary reign of evil, permitted for a time to fully reveal its nature and vindicate God's character.
    *   **Implementation**: Actively "taste and see" God's goodness daily through prayer, Bible study, and recognizing His blessings. When facing trials, consciously recall His revealed character of goodness and light. Trust His ultimate purposes, even when His ways are inscrutable now. Share this confidence in God's goodness with those struggling.

### Tuesday: God's Changeless Character [*] (8 min)

*   **Central Point**: God's moral character—His love, justice, goodness, faithfulness—is unchanging. This provides an unshakable foundation for our trust, hope, and relationship with Him.
*   **Biblical Foundation**:
    *   **Malachi 3:6**: "For I the LORD do not change; therefore you, O children of Jacob, are not consumed." (His moral constancy ensures His covenant faithfulness and mercy endure despite Israel's failings).
    *   **James 1:17**: "Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change." (His goodness is consistent; He is the reliable source of all good).
    *   **Hebrews 13:8**: "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever." (The divine nature, revealed in Christ, is eternally consistent).
    *   **Titus 1:2**: "...in hope of eternal life, which God, who never lies, promised before the ages began..." (His inability to lie guarantees His promises).
    *   **Hebrews 6:17-18**: God confirmed His promise with an oath, providing "two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie," so we might have strong encouragement. (His word and oath are absolutely reliable because His character is).
    *   **2 Timothy 2:13**: "...if we are faithless, he remains faithful—for he cannot deny himself." (His faithfulness is rooted in His unchanging nature, not our performance).
*   **Ellen G. White Insights**:
    *   "God always has been. He is the great I AM... from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God... With Him there is no variableness, neither shadow of turning." (FLB 42.2-3). His eternal nature guarantees His stability.
    *   "It was because the law was changeless, because man could be saved only through obedience to its precepts, that Jesus was lifted up on the cross." (DA 762.4). The cross demonstrates both unchanging justice *and* unchanging love.
    *   "God's goodness is to be made known. 'Ye are My witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God.'" (COL 299.2). Our role is to testify to this reliable, good character.
*   **Character Application**:
    *   **Problem**: We live in a world of constant change, uncertainty, and broken promises. It's hard to find something truly reliable to trust.
    *   **Solution**: Anchor your soul to the unchanging character of God. His love, justice, and promises are eternally consistent. The Cross is the ultimate proof: God upheld His unchanging law (justice) while demonstrating His unchanging love and providing a way for forgiveness.
    *   **Implementation**: When facing instability, consciously meditate on God's unchanging attributes (Mal 3:6, Heb 13:8). Base your hope not on shifting circumstances but on His reliable character and promises. Learn to trust His goodness even when His actions are difficult to understand, knowing His core nature never changes.

### Wednesday: A Repenting God? (Integrate points into Tuesday/Thursday or omit if time is short)

*   **Key Point**: Biblical instances of God "relenting" or "repenting" (e.g., Exod. 32:14 after Moses' plea, Jer. 18:7-10 regarding nations) do *not* indicate a change in His character or moral principles. They show Him altering His *planned course of action* in response to human repentance or intercession, always consistent with His unchanging love, mercy, and justice. He doesn't "repent" like humans who admit wrongdoing (Num. 23:19, 1 Sam. 15:29).
*   **EGW**: Moses understood God's "Let Me alone" (Ex 32:10) as an *invitation* to intercede, demonstrating God's desire for mercy (PP 318-319). God always gives warnings before judgment, desiring repentance (DA 634).
*   **Application**: This shows our relationship with God is real and dynamic; our choices and prayers matter to Him. It highlights His mercy and responsiveness, rooted in His unchanging character.

### Thursday: Hold Fast to Love and Justice (7 min)

*   **Central Point**: Because God is perfectly loving, just, good, and faithful, we are called to trust Him completely and actively reflect these same qualities in our own lives, holding fast to them continually.
*   **Biblical Foundation**:
    *   **Deuteronomy 7:9**: Know He is the "faithful God who keeps covenant and steadfast love...". Trust His faithfulness.
    *   **Psalm 100:5**: "For the LORD is good; his steadfast love endures forever, and his faithfulness to all generations." His enduring character invites our trust.
    *   **Matthew 5:44-45, 48**: "Love your enemies... so that you may be sons of your Father... You therefore must be perfect [complete, mature in love], as your heavenly Father is perfect." Reflect His impartial, complete love.
    *   **Hosea 12:6 (NKJV/ESV)**: "So you, by the help of your God, return, observe mercy and justice [hold fast to love and justice], and wait continually for your God." Our response to His character is active obedience.
    *   **Isaiah 25:1**: "O LORD, you are my God; I will exalt you; I will praise your name, for you have done wonderful things, plans formed of old, faithful and true." Praise Him for His reliable character and actions.
    *   **Revelation 15:3-4**: The redeemed sing of His works ("great and marvelous") and His ways ("just and true"). His character will be universally acknowledged.
*   **Ellen G. White Insights**:
    *   Christ revealed the Father's character: "long-suffering, merciful, and gracious, slow to anger, and full of goodness and truth." Our lives should reveal the same (CT 29.2).
    *   The final song merges Moses (God's justice, providence) and the Lamb (God's grace, redemption), showing the harmony of His attributes (TM 433.1).
    *   "Praise the Lord even when you fall into darkness. Praise Him even in temptation... it will bring a sunbeam." Actively choose to trust and praise His character (2T 593.3). Scatter this light.
*   **Character Application**:
    *   **Problem**: It's easy to become discouraged by injustice or tempted to compromise our principles for expediency. We forget to actively cultivate love and justice.
    *   **Solution**: Consciously "hold fast" to God's standard of love and justice, drawing strength from His unchanging character. Trust His ultimate vindication.
    *   **Implementation**: Identify specific areas where you can better "do justice" and "love mercy" this week. How can you show God's impartial love, even to those difficult to love? Make praising God for His faithfulness a deliberate practice, especially in hard times. Let your life be a testimony that furthers justice and reflects His love.

### Conclusion (7 min)

*   **Summary**: We've explored the glorious character of our God: His inseparable love and justice, His inherent goodness and righteousness, His absolute faithfulness, and His unchanging nature. Unlike the false gods of fear and caprice, our God is the bedrock of truth, love, and justice.
*   **Character Imperative**: Understanding God's character is not merely theological exercise; it is the foundation of our transformation. "Beholding Jesus" means beholding the Father's character (John 14:9). Our highest calling, the very purpose of the plan of salvation, is to have His image, His character of love and righteousness, restored in us.
*   **Call to Action**:
    *   **Self-Examination**: Do you truly know God as One who delights in lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness? Do you trust His goodness even amidst trials? Are you actively seeking to reflect *both* His love and His justice?
    *   **Practical Steps**:
        1.  **Taste and See**: Commit to spending time daily beholding God's character in Scripture and prayer, asking the Spirit to impress His goodness upon your heart.
        2.  **Hold Fast**: Identify one relationship or situation this week where you will intentionally practice *both* love (mercy, kindness) and justice (fairness, accountability), reflecting God's balanced character.
        3.  **Witness**: Share the hope found in God's reliable and loving character with someone who is struggling or disillusioned.
*   **Final Appeal & Urgency**: Our God is trustworthy, His love is perfect, His justice is sure. As we see Bible prophecy fulfilling and the return of Jesus drawing near, let us anchor our souls to His unchanging character. Let us strive, by His grace, to become living reflections of His love and justice, preparing ourselves and warning the world for His soon coming. Let us be found faithful, holding fast to Him who is faithful and true. Amen.
