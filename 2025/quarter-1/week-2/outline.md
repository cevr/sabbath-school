### Introduction (5-7 mins)

*   **Greeting & Prayer:** Welcome class, open with prayer asking for the Holy Spirit's guidance into the depths of God's love.
*   **Hook:** Ask: "What comes to mind when you hear the word 'love'? Is God's love different from human love? How?" Briefly discuss the common understanding vs. biblical depth.
*   **Lesson Introduction:** This week, we explore "Covenantal Love." We'll delve into the profound, multifaceted nature of God's love for us – a love that is everlasting, personal, and forms the basis of His covenant relationship with humanity. We will see it's not just a feeling, but a principle, a commitment, demanding a response from us.
*   **Memory Text:** Read John 14:23 together. "Jesus answered and said to him, ‘If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him’" (NKJV). This text beautifully links our love and obedience to the indwelling presence of the Father and Son – the essence of covenant relationship.
*   **EGW Insight:** "God has a deep and earnest love for every member of the human family; not one is forgotten, not one is left helpless..." (FE 299.1). God's love is intensely personal and active.

### Sunday - The Everlasting Love of God (6-8 mins)

*   **Central Point:** God's love is universal, unconditional in its source, everlasting, and He desires every person to be saved.
*   **Biblical Foundation:**
    *   **John 3:16:** "For God so loved the world..." – The scope is universal.
    *   **Psalm 33:5; Psalm 145:9:** "The earth is full of the goodness [hesed] of the LORD." "The LORD is good to all, And His tender mercies are over all His works." – His loving-kindness and compassion extend everywhere.
    *   **Jeremiah 31:3:** "Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love; Therefore with lovingkindness I have drawn you." – His love doesn't end.
    *   **2 Peter 3:9; 1 Timothy 2:4; Ezekiel 33:11:** God is "not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance," He "desires all men to be saved," He has "no pleasure in the death of the wicked." – His desire is universal salvation.
    *   **John 3:17:** He sent His Son "not to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved."
*   **EGW Insights:**
    *   "Heaven's plan of salvation is broad enough to embrace the whole world." (PK 377.2).
    *   "Not even a sparrow falls to the ground without the Father's notice... 'Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.'" (8T 272, 273). God's care is minutely personal, even amidst His universal love.
*   **Character Application:**
    *   **Problem:** We often find it easy to exclude certain people from our circle of care or deem them "unlovable."
    *   **Solution:** Recognizing God's universal, everlasting love for *everyone*, even the "despicable characters" (Lesson, p. 13), challenges our prejudices.
    *   **Implementation:** How should knowing God loves even those who seem unlovable change how we view them, pray for them, and interact with them? It should motivate us towards Christlike compassion, reflecting His character.

### Monday - Covenantal Love (6-8 mins)

*   **Central Point:** God establishes a special, covenant relationship with His people, characterized by *hesed* (steadfast, loyal, loving-kindness), which invites and expects a faithful response.
*   **Biblical Foundation:**
    *   **Deuteronomy 7:6-9:** God chose Israel not because they were great, but because of His love and oath (*hesed*). Verse 9 defines Him as "the faithful God who keeps covenant and mercy [*hesed*] for a thousand generations with those who love Him and keep His commandments."
    *   **Key Term - *Hesed*:** Explain this Hebrew word – more than just emotion. It implies loyalty, faithfulness, steadfastness, mercy, and goodness within a relationship. It's God's commitment to His covenant people.
    *   **Relational Aspect:** God's *hesed* is reliable and enduring, but the *experience* of its benefits within the covenant is linked to the people's response (v. 9b - "those who love Him and keep His commandments"). See also 2 Sam. 22:26; Ps. 25:10.
    *   **Ultimate Expression:** John 15:13 ("Greater love has no one than this..."); Philippians 2:8 (Christ's death). God's *hesed* is supremely shown in Christ's sacrifice.
*   **EGW Insights:**
    *   "Here are the conditions upon which every soul will be elected to eternal life. Your obedience to God's commandments will prove your right to an inheritance..." (FE 125.2). Election is tied to character developed through obedient response to God's grace.
    *   "Through the infinite sacrifice of Christ, and faith in His name, the sons of Adam become the sons of God... What a value this places upon man!" (4T 563.2). God's covenant love elevates us.
*   **Character Application:**
    *   **Problem:** We can forget the depth of God's commitment or take His love for granted.
    *   **Solution:** Actively remembering God's *hesed*, His unwavering covenant faithfulness demonstrated supremely at the cross.
    *   **Implementation:** How can we "constantly keep the reality of God's love in [our] thoughts"? (Lesson, p. 14). Suggest practical ways: daily reflection on the cross, meditating on His promises, recognizing His *hesed* in daily life, responding with faithful obedience. This builds trust and transforms character.

### Tuesday - Conditional Relationship [*] (6-8 mins)

*   **Central Point:** While God's love itself is everlasting and never ceases, enjoying the full benefits and blessings of the saving *relationship* with Him is conditional upon our acceptance and response.
*   **Biblical Foundation:**
    *   **John 14:21, 23:** Loving Jesus = keeping His commandments = being loved by the Father = manifestation of Christ & indwelling of God. Our response opens the door to deeper experience.
    *   **John 16:27:** "The Father Himself loves [phileo] you, because you have loved [phileo] Me..." Human love for Christ is met with Divine *phileo*.
    *   **Hosea 9:15 vs. 14:4:** God says "I will love them no more" (referring to withdrawing covenant blessings due to persistent sin), yet later promises "I will love them freely" (showing His underlying desire to restore). This isn't God ceasing to love, but the consequences of rejecting the relationship.
    *   **Romans 11:22:** "Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, *if you continue in His goodness*. Otherwise you also will be cut off." Continuance in the relationship matters.
    *   **Jude 21:** "Keep yourselves in the love of God..." We have a role in maintaining the relational connection.
*   **EGW Insights:**
    *   "Holding up Christ... presenting His matchless love... in no case does away with the law... This joy [of Christ's righteousness] is only for those who love and keep the words of Jesus..." (3SM 176.1). Experiencing justification is linked to a responsive heart.
    *   "Now sin has marred God's perfect work, yet that handwriting remains. Even now all created things declare the glory of His excellence." (DA 20.2). God's love is revealed in nature, available for all to see, whether they respond relationally or not.
*   **Character Application:**
    *   **Problem:** Misunderstanding conditionality as God being fickle or His love being earned.
    *   **Solution:** Understand that our choices impact our *experience* of God's love and the blessings of the covenant relationship. Like choosing to step out of the sun's warmth, we can choose to step away from the full experience of His relational blessings.
    *   **Implementation:** Recognize that obedience isn't earning love, but responding *to* love. It's maintaining the connection He initiated. How does seeing nature's testimony (DA 20.2) remind us of His constant love, even when people reject the relationship? It encourages us to remain in His love.

### Wednesday - Mercy Forfeited (6-8 mins)

*   **Central Point:** God's love and mercy initiate the relationship and are unmerited, but they can be ultimately rejected or forfeited, particularly demonstrated when we fail to extend to others the mercy we have received.
*   **Biblical Foundation:**
    *   **1 John 4:7, 19:** "We love Him because He first loved us." God's love is the priority, the source. We respond to His initiative.
    *   **Matthew 18:23-35 (Parable of the Unforgiving Servant):**
        *   Huge debt (10,000 talents = impossible to repay) represents our sin debt to God.
        *   Master's compassion and forgiveness = God's unmerited grace.
        *   Servant's refusal to forgive small debt (100 denarii) = Our failure to show mercy.
        *   Master rescinds forgiveness = Forfeiting God's mercy through our own unforgiving spirit.
    *   **The Principle:** While God's compassion is vast, our rejection of His character (by refusing to be merciful) ultimately separates us from the benefits of His mercy.
*   **EGW Insights:**
    *   "[The unforgiving servant] did not realize his helplessness. He hoped to deliver himself... So there are many who hope by their own works to merit God's favor... Their own hearts are not broken and humbled on account of sin, and they are exacting and unforgiving toward others." (COL 245.1). Lack of recognizing our own need hinders receiving and giving grace.
    *   "Man can be saved only through the wonderful forbearance of God... But those who are blessed by the mercy of God should exercise the same spirit of forbearance and forgiveness toward those who constitute the Lord's family." (UL 43.3, 4). Receiving mercy obligates us to show mercy.
*   **Character Application:**
    *   **Problem:** Taking God's forgiveness for granted and harboring unforgiveness towards others.
    *   **Solution:** Deeply contemplate the infinite cost of our forgiveness (Christ's sacrifice) and the immensity of the debt forgiven. Let this break our hearts and cultivate a spirit of profound gratitude and mercy.
    *   **Implementation:** "Think about what you have been forgiven and what it cost you... What should this tell you about forgiving others?" (Lesson, p. 16). Make a conscious decision to forgive others as Christ has forgiven you, recognizing this is essential to remaining in the flow of His grace and developing His character.

### Thursday - You Have Freely Received; Freely Give [*] (5-7 mins)

*   **Central Point:** Having received God's immeasurable love and forgiveness freely, our genuine response is to reflect that same love, compassion, and forgiveness towards others.
*   **Biblical Foundation:**
    *   **Romans 5:8:** "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us." We received love when utterly undeserving.
    *   **1 John 3:1:** "Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God!" Reflect on the status His love gives us.
    *   **John 15:12:** "This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you." The standard for our love is His love.
    *   **1 John 3:16:** "By this we know love, because He laid down His life for us. And we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren." His sacrifice defines love and calls for our selflessness.
    *   **1 John 4:7-12:** Loving one another is evidence of knowing God and having His love perfected in us. "If God so loved us, we also ought to love one another" (v. 11).
    *   **Luke 7:47:** "Therefore I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little." Gratitude for forgiveness fuels love for God and others.
*   **EGW Insights:**
    *   "The character of the one who comes to God in faith will bear witness that the Saviour has entered into his life... Constantly he looks to Jesus... He consults the will of his divine Friend..." (TDG 296.3). True faith results in a life directed by Christ's love.
    *   "Those who identify their interests wholly with Christ will want to serve him... the more they work the works of Christ in seeking to bless others, the more will Jesus impart his light and his love to them, that they may communicate it to others." (YI, Aug 18, 1886, par. 6). Serving others deepens our connection with Christ and His love.
*   **Character Application:**
    *   **Problem:** Professing love for God while neglecting or mistreating others. Failing to share the hope we have received.
    *   **Solution:** Recognize that loving others is the natural outflow and evidence of truly receiving God's love. It's not optional; it's the core of Christian living.
    *   **Implementation:** "What specific steps can you take to love God by loving others?" (Lesson, p. 17). Brainstorm practical actions: acts of kindness, patient listening, sharing resources, forgiving wrongs, sharing the Gospel message in word and deed. Connect these daily actions to the development of Christlike character and the urgency of sharing the hope of eternal life.

### Conclusion (5-8 mins)

*   **Summary:** We've explored God's Covenantal Love – it's everlasting, universal in scope (He desires all to be saved), yet deeply personal and relational (*hesed*). It initiated our salvation before we asked. While His love never fails, our experience of its fullness depends on our response – accepting it, keeping His word (John 14:23), and reflecting it to others through forgiveness and compassion.
*   **Character Focus:** The ultimate goal is the restoration of God's image in us. Receiving and reflecting His covenantal love is central to this process. Are we becoming more like Jesus in our love? Are we demonstrating the *hesed* of God in our relationships?
*   **Call to Action:** Let us not be like the unforgiving servant. Having been forgiven an immeasurable debt, let us "freely give" the love, mercy, and forgiveness we have "freely received." Let us consciously "keep ourselves in the love of God" (Jude 21) through faith, obedience, and active love for others.
*   **Final Thought/Urgency:** Remember the promise: "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him" (John 14:23). This intimate relationship, this indwelling, is the preparation needed for Christ's soon return. Let His covenantal love transform our characters today.
*   **Closing Prayer:** Pray for a deeper appreciation of God's love and the grace to reflect it faithfully.
