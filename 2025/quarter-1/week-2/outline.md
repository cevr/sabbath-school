**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

**I. Introduction (5-7 mins)**
    *   Hook: "What comes to mind when you hear the word 'covenant'? Is it just an old agreement, or something deeply personal and life-changing?" Briefly mention marriage as a modern covenant parallel.
    *   Theme Introduction: Introduce "Covenant Love" – not just any love, but God's steadfast, committed, relational love that invites us into a deep bond with Him. This isn't superficial; it's the foundation of our salvation and character.
        *   *(Whiteboard: Write Main Theme Title: Covenant Love: Receiving & Reflecting)*
    *   Connection to Character/Eternity: This love isn't just to make us feel good; it's designed to *change* us. Responding to it shapes the character needed to stand in the last days and live eternally with Him. (John 14:23 - He makes His *home* with us).
    *   Roadmap: Briefly outline: 1. God's Amazing Initiative (His *Hesed*), 2. Our Necessary Response (Keeping His Word), 3. The Resulting Transformation (Reflecting His Love).

**II. God's Unfailing Covenant Love: The Divine Initiative (10-12 mins)**
    *   **A. Everlasting & Unmerited Foundation:**
        *   Core Teaching Point: God's love (*agape*, *phileo*, *hesed*) is the starting point. It's everlasting (Jer 31:3), demonstrated while we were sinners (Rom 5:8), and extends to *everyone* (John 3:16, Ps 145:9). He loved us *first* (1 John 4:19).
        *   Biblical Foundation: John 3:16, 1 John 4:19, Rom 5:8 - Emphasize God's initiative, His reaching out before we sought Him.
        *   EGW Insight: "Heaven's plan of salvation is broad enough to embrace the whole world. God longs to breathe into prostrate humanity the breath of life." (PK 377.3). He doesn't wait for us to be worthy.

    *   **B. The Depth of *Hesed* - Covenant Loyalty:** [*]
        *   Core Teaching Point: Deuteronomy 7 introduces *hesed* - often translated lovingkindness/mercy. It's more than emotion; it's steadfast, loyal love *within a covenant relationship*. God commits Himself to His people with unwavering faithfulness.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Deut 7:6-9 - God chose Israel not because they were great, but because of His love and oath (covenant). His *hesed* is tied to His faithfulness.
        *   Application/Problem Tackled: We often doubt God's love based on feelings or circumstances. Understanding *hesed* anchors us in His *commitment*, not just His feelings or ours.

    *   ***Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2):***
        *   *Analogy:* A faithful marriage partner who remains true even when the other struggles. God's *hesed* is His unwavering marital vow to His people.
        *   *Metaphor:* God's love is like the sun – always shining (DA 20). We might turn away or hide, but the sun's nature doesn't change. His love is constant.
        *   *Hypothetical:* Imagine a King adopting a street orphan, not because the orphan earned it, but out of pure compassion and desire for relationship. That's God's initiative.

    *   ***Whiteboard Visuals:***
        *   *Keyword:* HESED (Loyal Love)
        *   *Diagram:* GOD -> (Unconditional Love Initiative) -> US
        *   *Verse:* 1 John 4:19 ("We love Him because He first loved us.")
        *   *Quote Snippet:* "...broad enough to embrace the whole world." (PK 377)

    *   ***Discussion Questions (Allow brief time):***
        *   *(Simple/Observation):* "In 1 John 4:19, who acted first in this love relationship?"
        *   *(Reflection):* "How does knowing God's love is based on His steadfast *commitment* (hesed), not just emotion, help you when you feel unworthy or distant?"
        *   *(Application):* "Think of one way God has shown His initiating, undeserved love to you personally this past week."

**III. Our Response: The Condition of Blessing & Abiding (10-12 mins)**
    *   **A. Love Requires a Response: Keeping His Word:**
        *   Core Teaching Point: While God's love is unconditional, enjoying the *fullness* and *benefits* of the covenant relationship *is* conditional upon our response. Jesus clearly links loving Him with keeping His commandments (John 14:15, 21, 23). This isn't earning salvation, but the natural fruit of receiving His love.
        *   Biblical Foundation: John 14:23 (Memory Text), Deut 7:9b ("...keeps covenant and mercy... with those who love Him and keep His commandments"). Obedience is the evidence and expression of love.
        *   EGW Insight: "Your obedience to God's commandments will prove your right to an inheritance... Christians are chosen to sanctification through obedience to the truth." (FE 125.2). Election isn't unconditional salvation regardless of life; it's election *to holiness*.

    *   **B. Abiding in Love: Maintaining the Connection:** [*]
        *   Core Teaching Point: Texts like Rom 11:22 ("...continue in His goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off") and Jude 21 ("Keep yourselves in the love of God...") show that while God never stops loving us, we *can* choose to reject or step out of the relationship and forfeit its saving benefits. It's about *remaining* connected.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Rom 11:22, Jude 21, Hosea 9:15 vs 14:4 (God's withdrawal of *blessing/presence* due to persistent rebellion, not cessation of underlying love/desire for restoration).
        *   Application/Obstacles to Depth: Pride, self-reliance, cherishing known sin – these break the connection. We must actively choose to "keep" ourselves in His love through faith and obedience.

    *   ***Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2):***
        *   *Analogy:* A branch abiding in the vine (John 15). The vine provides life, but the branch must remain connected to receive it. Cutting oneself off stops the flow.
        *   *Modern Parable (Hypothetical):* Someone receives a free, life-saving medicine but refuses to take it according to the instructions. The medicine remains available and potent, but their refusal forfeits the benefit. We can refuse to "take" God's grace through disobedience.
        *   *Idiom:* "Meeting someone halfway." God has come all the way to us in Christ; our response is to accept and walk with Him.

        *   *Keyword:* RESPONSE / OBEDIENCE / ABIDING
        *   *Diagram:* GOD <-> (Reciprocal Relationship: Love & Obedience) <-> US
        *   *Verse:* John 14:23 ("If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word...")
        *   *Quote Snippet:* "...chosen to sanctification through obedience..." (FE 125)

    *   ***Discussion Questions (Allow brief time):***
        *   *(Simple/Recall):* "According to Jesus in John 14, what is the primary way we show we love Him?" (Keep His word/commandments).
        *   *(Reflection):* "Why is obedience not about *earning* God's love, but rather the natural *result* of truly receiving it?"
        *   *(Application):* "What does it practically mean for you to 'keep yourself in the love of God' (Jude 21) this week? What choices does that involve?"

**IV. Freely Received, Freely Give: Character Transformation for Eternity (10 mins)** [*]
    *   **A. The Unpayable Debt & Forgiveness:**
        *   Core Teaching Point: We have received forgiveness for an unpayable debt (Matt 18:23-35). Recognizing the magnitude of God's grace and forgiveness towards us is crucial. This realization breaks down our pride and self-righteousness.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Matt 18:23-35 (Parable of Unforgiving Servant). Compare the 10,000 talents (impossible debt) to the 100 denarii (manageable). Our sin against God vs. others' offenses against us.
        *   EGW Insight: "Their own sins against God, compared with their brother's sins against them, are as ten thousand talents to one hundred pence... yet they dare to be unforgiving." (COL 245.3). Failure to forgive shows we haven't grasped God's forgiveness.

    *   **B. Reflecting Covenant Love: The Mark of True Discipleship:**
        *   Core Teaching Point: The ultimate evidence of receiving God's covenant love is reflecting it to others (John 15:12, 1 John 4:7-12). This includes forgiveness, compassion, and actively sharing the hope we have received. This character transformation *is* our preparation for His coming.
        *   Biblical Foundation: John 15:12 ("Love one another as I have loved you"), 1 John 3:16 ("By this we know love, because He laid down His life for us. And we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren."), Matt 18:33 ("Should you not also have had compassion on your fellow servant, just as I had pity on you?").
        *   EGW Insight: "The character of the one who comes to God in faith will bear witness that the Saviour has entered into his life, directing all, pervading all." (TIMkH 296.3). Our transformed actions are the proof.
        *   Application/End-Time Relevance: A people who reflect God's self-sacrificing love and forgiveness, even amidst provocation, will be the final demonstration of His character before the universe (Great Controversy theme). This is fitness for heaven.

    *   ***Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2):***
        *   *Visual Metaphor:* We are mirrors. When turned towards the Son (Sun), we reflect His light/love to others. Turned away (in selfishness/unforgiveness), we reflect nothing.
        *   *Analogy:* A pipeline. God pours His love/grace into us; we are meant to be conduits, letting it flow through us to others, not reservoirs hoarding it. Unforgiveness clogs the pipe.

    *   ***Whiteboard Visuals:***
        *   *Keyword:* REFLECTION / FORGIVENESS / CHARACTER
        *   *Diagram:* GOD -> US (Transformed Heart) -> OTHERS (Love/Forgiveness)
        *   *Verse:* John 15:12 / Matt 18:33
        *   *Question:* Mirror or Reservoir?

    *   ***Discussion Questions (Allow brief time):***
        *   *(Simple/Observation):* "In the parable (Matt 18), why was the master angry with the first servant?" (Because he didn't show the same mercy he had received).
        *   *(Reflection):* "How does holding onto unforgiveness hinder our own relationship with God and our spiritual growth?"
        *   *(Application):* "What is one specific, practical step you can take this week to 'freely give' the love or forgiveness you have 'freely received' from God?"

**V. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)**
    *   Summary: God initiates with an amazing, steadfast Covenant Love (*Hesed*). Our response of loving obedience keeps us connected to Him. This connection transforms our character, enabling us to reflect His love, especially forgiveness, to others.
    *   Character Focus Recap: This isn't just theology; it's about becoming like Jesus. Reflecting His covenant love is the essence of sanctification and readiness for His return.
        *   *(Whiteboard: Key Character Trait: FAITHFUL LOVE)*
    *   Call to Action/Decision: Examine your heart. Have you truly grasped the depth of God's forgiving love for *you*? Are you actively choosing to abide in Him through obedience? Is His love flowing *through* you to others? Choose today to respond fully.
        *   *(Whiteboard: Call to Action Keyword: ABIDE & REFLECT)*
        *   *(Optional Final Question):* "What barrier (pride, unforgiveness, disobedience) will you ask God, by His grace, to help you remove this week so you can better receive and reflect His covenant love?" (Lead into prayer).
    *   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: "The relations between God and each soul are as distinct and full as though there were not another soul upon the earth... not another soul for whom He gave His beloved Son." (SC 100.4). Embrace this personal, transforming love today. He is coming soon for a people who reflect His character.
