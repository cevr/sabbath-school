**I. Introduction: The Inseparable Bond (5-7 minutes)**

*   **Opening Thought**: Begin by asking: Can someone truly claim to love God, whom they cannot see, if they fail to show love and concern for the people around them, whom they *can* see? This question lies at the heart of our lesson.
*   **Memory Text**: **1 John 4:20 (NKJV)**: "If someone says, 'I love God,' and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?"
    *   This text sets the stage: Love for God and love for humanity are not two separate duties but two facets of the same divine principle.
*   **Lesson Overview**: This week, we explore the two greatest commandments as the foundation of all true religion. We'll see how genuine love for God inevitably leads to a passion for justice and mercy towards others. This isn't just theology; it's about character transformation and readiness for eternity.
*   **Connecting Love and Justice**: God *is* love, and God *loves* justice (Psalm 33:5). Therefore, to love God is to love what He loves – including justice. We cannot separate them. Our actions towards others reveal the true state of our relationship with God.

**II. The Foundation: The Two Greatest Commandments (8-10 minutes)**

*   **Sunday - The Core Principles**
*   **Central Point**: Jesus identified supreme love for God and impartial love for our neighbor as the essence of the entire Law and the Prophets, the bedrock upon which all true obedience rests.
*   **Biblical Study**:
    *   **Matthew 22:34-40**: The lawyer asks Jesus for the greatest commandment.
        *   Jesus quotes **Deuteronomy 6:5**: "You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind." (v. 37) - This is the *first* and *great* commandment. Supreme devotion.
        *   Jesus adds **Leviticus 19:18**: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (v. 39) - This is the *second*, like the first in importance and principle. Impartial love.
        *   Jesus concludes: "On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets." (v. 40) - They are the summary and foundation.
    *   **Matthew 19:16-23**: The Rich Young Ruler.
        *   He asks how to gain eternal life. Jesus points him to the commandments (focusing on the second table – love to neighbor).
        *   When the ruler claims obedience, Jesus reveals the deeper requirement tied to the *first* commandment: "Go, sell what you have and give to the poor... and come, follow Me." (v. 21) - His possessions had become an idol, hindering supreme love for God and practical love for the needy.
*   **EGW Insight**:
    *   "He presented the law as a divine unity, and in this lesson taught that it is not possible to keep one precept, and break another; for the same principle runs through them all. Man's destiny will be determined by his obedience to the whole law. Supreme love to God and impartial love to man are the principles to be wrought out in the life." (DA 497.4)
    *   Regarding the ruler: "His exalted position and his possessions were exerting a subtle influence for evil upon his character. If cherished, they would supplant God in his affections... To keep back little or much from God was to retain that which would lessen his moral strength and efficiency..." (DA 520.1)
*   **Character Application**: What earthly attachments or self-interests compete for supremacy in our hearts, hindering wholehearted love for God? How does this lack of supreme love for God manifest in a lack of practical, self-sacrificing love for our neighbor? This is about character perfection – becoming like Jesus.

**III. The Antithesis: The Two Greatest Sins (5-7 minutes)**

*   **Monday - The Failures of Love**
*   **Central Point**: If the greatest commandments are love for God and neighbor, then the greatest sins are the direct opposites: idolatry (failure to love God supremely) and injustice/hatred (failure to love our neighbor).
*   **Biblical Study**:
    *   **Psalm 135:13-19**: Describes the vanity of idols – lifeless objects contrasted with the living God. Idolatry is placing trust and affection elsewhere.
        *   Anything that takes God's supreme place becomes an idol (possessions, position, self, even religious tradition). See SDA BC vol 2, 1011.
    *   **Zechariah 7:9-12**: God condemns injustice alongside hard hearts that refuse His law.
        *   "Execute true justice, Show mercy and compassion Everyone to his brother. Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, The alien or the poor. Let none of you plan evil in his heart Against his brother." (vv. 9-10)
        *   Their refusal led to hardened hearts (v. 12) – a direct consequence of failing to practice love and justice.
    *   **1 John 4:20-21**: Reiterates the impossibility of separating love for God from love for our brother. The command is explicit: "he who loves God must love his brother also."
*   **EGW Insight**:
    *   "If we love God with all the heart, we must love His children also. This love is the spirit of God. It is the heavenly adorning that gives true nobility and dignity to the soul and assimilates our lives to that of the Master... if the soul is not baptized with the heavenly grace of love to God and one another, we are deficient in true goodness and unfit for heaven, where all is love and unity." (4T 223.2)
*   **Character Application**: We must examine ourselves. Are we subtly practicing idolatry by prioritizing worldly concerns over God? Does this manifest as indifference or even participation in systems that oppress others? Recognizing these sins is the first step toward allowing God to restore His loving and just character in us.

**IV. The Mandate: God Loves Justice & Our Call to Act (10-12 minutes) [*]**

*   **Tuesday & Wednesday - Divine Passion and Human Responsibility**
*   **Central Point**: God possesses a righteous anger against injustice and oppression because He *is* love and He *loves* justice. Therefore, His followers are explicitly called to actively practice justice and mercy as core elements of their faith and witness.
*   **Biblical Study**:
    *   **Psalm 82**: God stands in judgment against unjust rulers (earthly and celestial forces behind them).
        *   The charge: "How long will you judge unjustly, And show partiality to the wicked?" (v. 2)
        *   The command: "Defend the poor and fatherless; Do justice to the afflicted and needy. Deliver the poor and needy; Free them from the hand of the wicked." (vv. 3-4) This is God's expectation.
    *   **Micah 6:8**: A concise summary of true religion: "He has shown you, O man, what is good; And what does the LORD require of you But to do justly, To love mercy, And to walk humbly with your God?" Justice and mercy are non-negotiable requirements.
    *   **Isaiah 1:17**: "Learn to do good; Seek justice, Rebuke the oppressor; Defend the fatherless, Plead for the widow." An active call.
    *   **Jeremiah 22:13, 15-16**: Condemns building wealth through injustice. Contrasts this with the righteous king: "Did not your father... do justice and righteousness?... He judged the cause of the poor and needy... Was not this knowing Me?' says the LORD." Knowing God = Doing Justice.
    *   **Matthew 23:23**: Jesus condemns the Pharisees for meticulous tithing while neglecting "the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith." He affirms both: "These you ought to have done, without leaving the others undone."
*   **EGW Insight**:
    *   "Every false religion teaches its adherents to be careless of human needs, sufferings, and rights. The gospel places a high value upon humanity as the purchase of the blood of Christ, and it teaches a tender regard for the wants and woes of man." (DA 287.1)
    *   "Jesus was misunderstood... He hated but one thing in the world, and that was sin. He could not witness a wrong act without pain... Because the life of Jesus condemned evil, He was opposed..." (DA 88.3) His life embodied justice and mercy.
*   **Illustration**: Imagine a meticulously maintained temple where worshippers carefully count tiny seeds for offerings but ignore the cries of the poor and oppressed at the temple gates. Jesus says their priorities are dangerously skewed. Are ours?
*   **Character Application**: How can we move beyond mere sentiment to actively "do justly" and "love mercy"? This requires intentionality – educating ourselves about injustice, speaking against oppression, using our resources to help the needy, treating employees fairly, caring for the vulnerable in our church and community. This active engagement shapes our character into Christ's likeness.

**V. The Scope: Who Is My Neighbor? (5-7 minutes) [*]**

*   **Thursday - Expanding Our Circle of Concern**
*   **Central Point**: Jesus radically redefined "neighbor" not by proximity or similarity, but by need. Our neighbor is anyone we encounter who needs compassion and help, regardless of any social barriers.
*   **Biblical Study**:
    *   **Luke 10:25-37**: The Parable of the Good Samaritan.
        *   The lawyer, seeking to justify himself after affirming the two great commandments, asks, "And who is my neighbor?" (v. 29)
        *   Jesus tells the story: Priest and Levite (religious leaders) pass by the wounded man. The Samaritan (despised outsider) shows compassion and provides extensive care.
        *   Jesus reverses the question: "So which of these three do you think was neighbor to him who fell among the thieves?" (v. 36) The answer: "He who showed mercy on him."
        *   The command: "Go and do likewise." (v. 37) Neighborliness is defined by action, specifically merciful action.
    *   **Luke 4:16-21 (cf. Isaiah 61:1-2)**: Jesus announces His mission – good news to the poor, healing for the brokenhearted, liberty to captives, recovery of sight to the blind, setting at liberty those oppressed. His ministry embodied justice and mercy.
    *   **Psalm 146:7-9**: God "executes justice for the oppressed," "gives food to the hungry," frees prisoners, opens eyes, raises the bowed down, loves the righteous, watches over strangers, relieves the fatherless and widow. This is the character of the God we serve.
*   **EGW Insight**:
    *   "His character reveals the true significance of the law, and shows what is meant by loving our neighbor as ourselves. And when the children of God manifest mercy, kindness, and love toward all men, they also are witnessing to the character of the statutes of heaven... The love of God in the heart is the only spring of love toward our neighbor." (DA 505.1)
    *   "No matter how high the profession, he whose heart is not filled with love for God and his fellow men is not a true disciple of Christ... without love his faith would be worthless." (AA 318.3)
*   **Character Application**: Who are the people we mentally (or physically) "pass by on the other side"? The immigrant, the poor, the addict, the one from a different background or belief system? Pray for God to break down our prejudices and fill us with His compassion, enabling us to see and serve Christ in the person of those in need. This active love prepares us to meet Him.

**VI. Conclusion: Living the Law of Love (5-8 minutes)**

*   **Summary**: The two greatest commandments – loving God supremely and loving our neighbor impartially through acts of justice and mercy – are not mere suggestions; they are the very essence of God's law and character. They are inseparable.
*   **Character Imperative**: Our most important work is character building – becoming like Jesus. Living out these commandments is central to that process, allowing God to restore His image of love and justice in us.
*   **Call to Action**:
    *   **Examine**: Do our lives reflect a supreme love for God, or are idols present?
    *   **Act**: Are we actively seeking justice and showing mercy, or are we neglecting the "weightier matters"?
    *   **Pray**: Ask for the "baptism of the heavenly grace of love" (4T 223) to transform our hearts and actions.
*   **Final Thought**: As we anticipate the soon return of Jesus, let us remember His focus on how we treat the "least of these" (Matthew 25:31-46). May our lives be characterized by the active love and justice that flow from a heart fully surrendered to God, demonstrating our readiness to meet Him in peace.
*   **Prayer**: Close with a prayer for the Holy Spirit's power to live out the principles of love and justice, reflecting Christ's character more fully each day.
