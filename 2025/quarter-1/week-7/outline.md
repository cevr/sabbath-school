## The Problem of Evil: God's Refining Purpose in the Great Controversy

**Overarching Theme:** Understanding the existence of evil within the Great Controversy framework as God's permitted proving ground for refining Christlike character, essential for eternal life and the vindication of His name.
**Central Focus:** Moving beyond *why* evil exists to *how* we respond in faith, allowing God to use the reality of evil and suffering to perfect our characters for His kingdom.
**Key Texts:** Job 38:1-4; Romans 8:18, 28; 1 Peter 1:6-7; Revelation 21:4

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

**I. Introduction: Facing the Darkness, Seeking the Light (5-7 mins)**
    *   Hook: "We live in a world saturated with suffering, injustice, and pain. From global tragedies to personal heartaches, the question echoes: 'If God is good and all-powerful, why does evil exist?' This isn't just a theological puzzle; it touches the core of our faith and experience."
    *   Theme Introduction: Today, we won't just ask *why* evil exists, but explore a deeper, profound truth: How God, in His infinite wisdom and love, *permits* and *overrules* the tragedy of evil within the Great Controversy to achieve His ultimate purpose – the perfection of character in His people.
        *   *(Whiteboard: Write Main Theme Title: Evil & God's Refining Purpose)*
    *   Connection to Character/Eternity: Understanding this isn't just academic. It's vital for developing the steadfast, Christlike character needed to stand firm in these last days and be ready for eternity. Our response to evil reveals and shapes who we are becoming.
    *   Roadmap: We'll briefly touch the origin, explore God's perspective versus ours (Job), see how He uses trials for refinement (Romans, Peter), and find hope in the ultimate victory (Revelation).

**II. The Cosmic Conflict & Our Limited Viewpoint (12-15 mins)**
    *   **A. The Origin & Permission of Evil (The Great Controversy Context):**
        *   Core Teaching Point: Evil wasn't created by God, who is pure love (1 John 4:16; PP 33). It arose from Satan's rebellion, rooted in pride and misuse of the free will necessary for genuine love and worship. God *permits* sin's terrible experiment to run its course to fully expose its nature and vindicate His just, loving government before the universe. (GC 492; PP 42-43).
        *   Biblical Foundation: Genesis 2:16-17 (Choice given); Isaiah 14:12-14 (Lucifer's ambition); Revelation 12:7-9 (War in Heaven).
        *   EGW Insight: "God might have created man without the power to transgress His law... but in that case man would have been, not a free moral agent, but a mere automaton. Without freedom of choice, his obedience would not have been voluntary, but forced." (CC 13).
        *   Application/Problem Tackled: Helps us understand God isn't the author of suffering, but allows the consequences of rebellion to demonstrate the horror of sin vs. the goodness of His law.

    *   **B. Job's Dilemma & God's Sovereignty:** [*]
        *   Core Teaching Point: Like Job, we often see only our immediate suffering and question God's justice. God's response to Job doesn't explain *why* specifically, but reveals His infinite wisdom, power, and sovereign perspective that we cannot fully grasp. Our role is trust, not full comprehension.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Job 38:1-4, 12 ("Where were you...?"; "Who is this that darkens counsel...?"). We see only a fraction of the cosmic picture.
        *   EGW Insight: "Skeptics refuse to believe, because with their finite minds they cannot comprehend the infinite power by which God reveals Himself to men." (3BC 1141). We must accept limits to our understanding.
        *   Application/Obstacles to Depth: Our desire for immediate answers can hinder faith. We must learn humility and trust God's character even when His ways are "past finding out" (Rom 11:33).

    *   ***Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2):***
        *   *Analogy:* We see the underside of a complex tapestry – tangled threads and knots. God sees the beautiful, finished design from above.
        *   *Hypothetical:* Imagine trying to understand a surgeon's intricate work by only seeing the initial incision – it looks like harm, but the purpose is healing. God's work in the Great Controversy is far more complex.

    *   ***Whiteboard Visuals:***
        *   *Keyword:* GREAT CONTROVERSY / TRUST
        *   *Diagram:* Simple Timeline: Heaven (Rebellion) -> Eden (Fall) -> Cross -> Now (Refining) -> End (Victory)
        *   *Verse:* Job 38:4 ("Where were you?")
        *   *Quote Snippet:* "...not a mere automaton." (CC 13)

    *   ***Discussion Questions (Allow brief time):***
        *   *(Simple/Observation):* "In Job 38, what kind of questions does God ask Job? (Questions about creation, nature, things beyond Job's control/knowledge)."
        *   *(Reflection):* "Why is it sometimes hard to trust God when we don't have all the answers, like Job didn't?"
        *   *(Application):* "How can remembering the 'Great Controversy' context help us maintain faith during personal suffering or when seeing evil in the world?"

**III. Refining Fires: God's Purpose in Trials (10-12 mins)**
    *   **A. Suffering as a Tool for Sanctification:**
        *   Core Teaching Point: While God doesn't cause evil, He permits trials and uses the presence of suffering (a consequence of sin) to purify our characters, burn away dross, and develop Christlikeness (patience, faith, endurance). This is essential preparation for heaven.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Romans 8:28 ("...all things work together for good..."); 1 Peter 1:6-7 (Trials testing faith like gold refined by fire); James 1:2-4 (Trials produce perseverance, leading to maturity/completeness).
        *   EGW Insight: "[T]he righteous are placed in the furnace of affliction, that they themselves may be purified; that their example may convince others of the reality of faith and godliness..." (GC 48). Also: "God is able and willing 'more abundantly' ... to bestow upon His servants the strength they need for test and trial." (PK 164).
        *   Application/Character Trait Focus: Trials develop patience, humility, dependence on God, empathy, and unwavering faith – the very character of Christ needed for the final generation.

    *   **B. Overcoming Through Christ:** [*]
        *   Core Teaching Point: We cannot endure or be refined by our own strength. Victory comes only through clinging to Christ, drawing on His divine power offered to us. He overcame, and through Him, we can too.
        *   Biblical Foundation: John 16:33 ("...in Me you may have peace... I have overcome the world."); Philippians 4:13 ("I can do all things through Christ..."); Romans 8:37 ("...we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.").
        *   EGW Insight: "Man must work with his human power, aided by the divine power of Christ, to resist and to conquer at any cost to himself... Man must be a co-worker with Christ in the labor of overcoming..." (4T 32).
        *   Application/End-Time Relevance: Developing this overcoming character *now* through daily surrender and reliance on Christ in small and large trials is direct preparation for the final crisis when we must stand solely on His merits.

    *   ***Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2):***
        *   *Visual Metaphor:* God as the Divine Goldsmith, using the heat of trials (permitted, not desired) to skim off the impurities (pride, selfishness, doubt) until He sees His own reflection (Christ's character) in us.
        *   *Analogy:* An athlete endures rigorous, painful training not because the coach enjoys inflicting pain, but to build strength and endurance needed to win the prize. Our "prize" is eternal life and a character fit for heaven.

    *   ***Whiteboard Visuals:***
        *   *Keyword:* REFINEMENT / SANCTIFICATION
        *   *Diagram:* Fire -> Impurities Out -> Pure Gold (Character)
        *   *Verse:* 1 Pet 1:7 / Rom 8:28
        *   *Question:* Daily Surrender?

    *   ***Discussion Questions (Allow brief time):***
        *   *(Simple/Recall):* "What metal does Peter compare our faith to when tested by trials? (Gold)" OR "According to Romans 8:28, what does God promise to do with 'all things' for those who love Him?"
        *   *(Reflection):* "How does the idea of being 'co-workers with Christ' in overcoming change how we might view struggles?"
        *   *(Application):* "Thinking of the 'goldsmith' metaphor, what 'impurity' (like impatience, fear, or pride) could you ask God to help refine out of your character through His strength this week?"

**IV. Conclusion: Love's Ultimate Victory & Our Urgent Calling (5-8 mins)**
    *   Summary: Evil is real, its origin lies in rebellion against God's love, and our view is limited. But God, within the Great Controversy, permits trials not to harm, but to *refine* us, building characters fit for eternity through faith and reliance on Christ.
    *   Character Focus Recap: The ultimate answer to evil is seen at the Cross, where Love suffered infinitely to conquer sin. God calls us to develop characters reflecting that same self-sacrificing love and unwavering faithfulness.
        *   *(Whiteboard: Key Character Trait: FAITHFULNESS / LOVE)*
    *   Call to Action/Decision: Don't let suffering make you bitter or doubtful. Choose today to trust God's unseen hand. Surrender your questions, your pain, your will to Him. Actively cooperate with His refining process by seeking Him daily in prayer and His Word.
        *   *(Whiteboard: Call to Action Keyword: TRUST / SURRENDER)*
        *   *(Optional Final Question):* "Reflecting on God's refining purpose, what specific area of your character will you intentionally ask Him to strengthen this week?" (Lead into prayer)
    *   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The struggle is real, but the outcome is certain! "God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying... for the former things have passed away" (Rev 21:4). Let us press on, allowing Him to perfect His character in us, ready for that glorious day!
