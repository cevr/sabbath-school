**I. Introduction (6 min)**

*   **Opening:** Acknowledge the profound, universal question: If God is all-good and all-powerful, why does evil exist? This isn't just academic; it touches our lives deeply (GC 492.1). Many struggle with this, some even turning from God.
*   **Theodicy Defined:** Briefly explain "theodicy" – not justifying evil itself, but justifying *God* in the face of evil. Our goal isn't to explain *away* suffering, but to understand God's character and plan *despite* it.
*   **Foundation:** Our understanding rests on God's revealed Word and the framework of the Great Controversy between Christ and Satan.
*   **Ultimate Hope:** Frame the discussion with the Memory Text (Rev 21:4). This is the promised end – complete restoration and the absence of evil. Our journey is toward this reality.
*   **Character Goal:** How we navigate this question shapes our character and our trust in God. Will we trust Him even when we don't fully understand?

**II. The Cry of Humanity & God's Response (10 min)**

*   **Sunday - "How Long, O Lord?"**
    *   **Central Point:** Scripture honestly portrays the human struggle with evil and suffering, validating our questions.
    *   **Bible Study:**
        *   **Job 30:26:** Job expected good, but evil came. A personal lament.
        *   **Jeremiah 12:1:** Why do the wicked prosper? A question of justice.
        *   **Psalm 10:1; Psalm 73:2-16:** Why does God seem distant or hidden when the righteous suffer and the wicked flourish?
        *   **Malachi 2:17:** People wearying God by questioning His justice ("Where is the God of judgment?").
        *   **Speaking Notes:** These aren't faithless questions, but cries from hearts grappling with reality. We should not trivialize evil; it is real and terrible. God permits the wicked to prosper temporarily to reveal their character and His ultimate justice (GC 48.1).
    *   **God's Identification with Suffering:**
        *   **Matthew 27:46:** Christ's cry, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" This is the ultimate expression of suffering the consequences of sin. God, in Christ, entered fully into the experience of separation and anguish caused by evil.
        *   **Speaking Notes:** Christ didn't suffer merely physical pain, but the "crushing weight of the sins of the world, and a sense of His Father's wrath" (GA 170.2). He understands our deepest pain. Even in that darkness, He trusted (Luke 23:46).
    *   **Character Application:** It's okay to cry out to God. He understands. Christ's suffering assures us of His empathy and His ultimate victory over evil. Can we, like Christ, trust even when hope seems distant?

**III. Limits of Human Understanding & Trust (10 min)**

*   **Monday - "There Are Many Things We Do Not Know"**
    *   **Central Point:** We must humbly accept the limits of our finite understanding regarding God's infinite ways and the complexities of the Great Controversy.
    *   **Bible Study:**
        *   **Job 38:1-12, 4:** God's response to Job doesn't answer *why* specifically, but reveals His majesty, wisdom, and Job's limited perspective. "Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?"
        *   **Job 42:3:** Job's response: "I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know."
        *   **Speaking Notes:** God reminds Job (and us) of the vast difference between Creator and creature. We don't see the whole picture of the cosmic conflict. "Divine inspiration asks many questions which the most profound scholar cannot answer... to make men know that their wisdom is limited" (SDA BC 3, 1141.2).
    *   **Character Application:** Cultivating humility. Recognizing our limitations leads to greater dependence on God. We must learn to live with unanswered questions, trusting His revealed character. "It is necessary for God to disappoint their hopes and frustrate their plans, that they may learn to trust in Him alone" (SDA BC 3, 1141.5).
*   **Tuesday - The Skeptical Theist & Sanctuary Perspective**
    *   **Central Point:** While we don't know all God's reasons, faith trusts He *has* good reasons. The sanctuary reveals the certainty of God's ultimate justice.
    *   **Bible Study:**
        *   **Isaiah 55:8-9:** "For My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways..." God's perspective transcends ours infinitely.
        *   **Psalm 73:** Asaph is deeply troubled by the prosperity of the wicked (v. 3-16) until he enters the sanctuary (v. 17). There, he understands their "end" and God's ultimate justice.
        *   **Speaking Notes:** "Skeptical theism" acknowledges our limits – just because *we* don't see a good reason doesn't mean God doesn't *have* one. The sanctuary points to the judgment, where all accounts will be settled righteously. God's ways, though mysterious now, are "merciful and good" (SDA BC 3, 1149.6).
    *   **Character Application:** Finding peace not in having all answers, but in trusting the Judge. The sanctuary doctrine assures us that justice will prevail, strengthening our faith amidst present injustice.

**IV. The Origin & Nature of Evil: Free Will & Love [*] (9 min)**
*[*This section can be condensed by focusing primarily on the necessity of free will for love, referencing Genesis 2-3 briefly]*

*   **Wednesday - The Freewill Defense**
    *   **Central Point:** Evil originated not with God, but from the misuse of free will, a gift essential for love and genuine relationship.
    *   **Bible Study:**
        *   **Genesis 2:16-17:** The command implies choice. Freedom was inherent in God's creation of beings capable of love.
        *   **Deuteronomy 30:19; Joshua 24:15:** Scripture consistently affirms human moral agency and choice.
        *   **Speaking Notes:** God desires "only the service of love; and love cannot be commanded; it cannot be won by force or authority. Only by love is love awakened" (DA 22.1). A universe of automatons would be devoid of genuine love and joy. God endowed humanity "with high intellectual powers" and freedom (CC 13.3). Evil is the tragic consequence of choosing against God's will (5T 503.2).
    *   **Analogy:** Would you prefer a robot dog (predictable, no mess, no real affection) or a real dog (potential for trouble, but capable of genuine companionship)? God valued genuine relationship, accepting the risk.
*   **Thursday - Love and Evil?**
    *   **Central Point:** God allows evil temporarily, not because He is indifferent, but because love requires freedom, and prematurely destroying evil would undermine trust and the very principles of His government.
    *   **Bible Study:**
        *   **Romans 8:18:** Present sufferings are temporary compared to future glory.
        *   **Revelation 21:3-4:** The ultimate goal is the eradication of evil and eternal fellowship with God.
        *   **Speaking Notes:** God hates sin. His character is love (PP 33.2). Allowing sin to run its course demonstrates its "terrible results" and vindicates God's law and character before the universe (PP 42.4, 43.1). "To know God is to love Him; His character must be manifested in contrast to the character of Satan" (DA 22.1). The Cross shows the depth of God's love and the cost He paid because He granted us freedom.
    *   **Character Application:** Understanding that God values our freedom profoundly. Recognizing that not everything that happens is God's *active* will, but occurs within the context of the freedom He grants and the ongoing Great Controversy. Trusting His ultimate purpose even through suffering (MB 30.3). Man must cooperate with Christ, using His strength to overcome (4T 32.3).

**V. Conclusion & Hope (7 min)**

*   **Summary:** We face a profound mystery. We don't have exhaustive answers to *why* each instance of suffering occurs.
*   **What We DO Know:**
    *   God is Love, Justice, and Mercy (PP 33; DA 22).
    *   Evil originated with Satan's misuse of free will, not God's design (5T 503; PP 33).
    *   God gave free will because it's essential for love and character (DA 22; CC 13).
    *   God identifies with our suffering through Christ (Matt 27:46; GA 170).
    *   God limits evil and brings good out of it for those who love Him (Rom 8:28 - *use cautiously, acknowledging deep pain*).
    *   God has a plan to ultimately eradicate evil and restore all things (Rev 21:4; PP 43). Justice will prevail (Psalm 73; GC 48).
*   **Call to Faith & Character:** The crucial question isn't "Why?" but "Will I trust Him?" Our response shapes our character. Will we, like Job, ultimately trust even without full understanding (Job 42:3)? Will we hold onto the promise of Revelation 21:4?
*   **Final Encouragement:** The Great Controversy is nearing its end. God's character will be fully vindicated. Let us anchor our faith in His revealed Word, His love demonstrated at Calvary, and the blessed hope of a world made new where "former things have passed away." Let us strive to reflect His character of love and faithfulness even amidst the darkness of this world.
