**I. Introduction (5-7 mins)**
_ Hook: Begin with God's poignant question from Isaiah 5:4 - "What more could have been done to My vineyard that I have not done in it?" Ask: Have you ever felt misunderstood despite doing your best? Imagine God feeling this on a cosmic scale.
_ Theme Introduction: Today, we explore the profound answer to this question – the Cross of Christ. It's not just a historical event; it's the centerpiece of the Great Controversy, God's ultimate self-vindication against Satan's lies. \* _(Whiteboard: Write Main Theme Title: The Cross: God's Ultimate Answer)_
_ Connection to Character/Eternity: Understanding the Cross is paramount. It reveals the depth of God's character we are called to reflect (sanctification) and provides the power to overcome, making us ready for Christ's soon return.
_ Roadmap: We'll examine (1) The Heartbreak Behind the Question, (2) The Cross as God's Definitive Answer, and (3) How We Live in the Victory of that Answer.

**II. The Heartbreak Behind the Question: God's Vineyard & Satan's Lies (10 mins)**
_ **A. God's Loving Investment & Painful Result (Isa 5:1-4):**
_ Core Teaching Point: God, like a loving vinedresser, invested everything in His creation (represented by Israel, but applicable universally), desiring good fruit (righteous character, loving obedience). Yet, He received "wild grapes" (sin, rebellion, misrepresentation of His character).
_ Biblical Foundation: Isaiah 5:1-4 - Detail God's careful preparation (cleared stones, choice vine, tower, winepress). Contrast His expectation with the bitter reality. This reflects God's sorrow over sin.
_ EGW Insight: "God in His Son had been seeking fruit, and had found none... They were not merely useless, but a decided hindrance. To a great degree their religion was misleading, and wrought ruin instead of salvation." (COL 215.1). \* Application/Problem Tackled: We see the root of the Great Controversy: Satan slanders God, claiming He is restrictive, unfair, unloving. Sinful choices ("wild grapes") seem to validate these lies, causing divine sorrow.

    *   **B. Satan's Underlying Accusation:** [*]
        *   Core Teaching Point: The enemy subtly (and overtly) questions God's justice and love. Can God be both just (upholding His perfect Law) and merciful (forgiving sinners)? Satan says no.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Genesis 3:1-5 (Questioning God's word/goodness); Job 1:9-11 (Accusing God's people of selfish motives); Rev 12:10 (The Accuser).
        *   Application/Obstacles to Depth: We struggle to trust God fully when we see suffering or face temptation, sometimes echoing Satan's doubts about God's goodness or fairness.

    *   ***Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1):***
        *   *Analogy:* A master artist creates a beautiful sculpture, pouring heart and soul into it, only to have it deliberately defaced. Imagine the artist's grief – this mirrors God's pain over sin.
        *   *Hypothetical:* A parent provides everything for a child – love, home, education, guidance – yet the child chooses rebellion and publicly dishonors the parent. This reflects the vineyard scenario.

    *   ***Whiteboard Visuals:***
        *   *Keyword:* VINEYARD / ACCUSER
        *   *Diagram:* Heartbroken Face beside "Wild Grapes" symbol (≠ Good Grapes)
        *   *Verse:* Isa 5:4 ("What more...?")
        *   *Question:* God: Just OR Loving? (Satan's False Dichotomy)

    *   ***Discussion Questions (Allow brief time):***
        *   *(Simple/Observation):* In Isaiah 5, what are some specific things God did for His vineyard?
        *   *(Reflection):* Why do you think people (like Israel, or even us today) sometimes produce "wild grapes" despite God's blessings?
        *   *(Application):* How can remembering God's loving investment, even when we fail, help us combat Satan's lies about His character?

**III. The Cross: God's Definitive Answer & Vindication (15 mins)**
_ **A. Demonstrating Perfect Justice AND Perfect Love (Rom 3:25-26):**
_ Core Teaching Point: The Cross is God's genius! Here, His absolute hatred for sin (justice demanding death) and His infinite love for sinners (providing a Substitute) meet perfectly. God remains just WHILE justifying believers.
_ Biblical Foundation: Rom 3:25-26 - Explain "propitiation" (satisfying God's justice) and "demonstration of His righteousness." God didn't ignore sin; He absorbed its penalty Himself in Christ. Rom 5:8 emphasizes this love ("while we were still sinners").
_ EGW Insight: "The atonement of Christ is not a mere skillful way to have our sins pardoned; it is a divine remedy for the cure of transgression and the restoration of spiritual health. It is the Heaven-ordained means by which the righteousness of Christ may be not only upon us but in our hearts and characters." (6BC 1074.4). \* Application/Problem Tackled: The Cross silences Satan's claim that God is either unjust or unloving. He is perfectly both. It answers the question "What more could He do?" with a resounding: NOTHING MORE.

    *   **B. Defeating the Accuser and the Power of Death (Heb 2:14; Rev 12:10-11):**
        *   Core Teaching Point: By dying, Christ entered Satan's domain (death) and broke its power, disarming the enemy. The Cross provides the basis for Satan's ultimate eviction from heaven and defeat.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Heb 2:14 - Christ partook of flesh and blood to "destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil." Rev 12:10-11 - Satan is cast down "by the blood of the Lamb."
        *   EGW Insight: "By shedding the blood of the Son of God, he [Satan] had uprooted himself from the sympathies of the heavenly beings. Henceforth his work was restricted." (DA 761 - from lesson context). "[W]ith the mighty argument of the cross, Christ silences the bold accuser." (COL 168.3).
        *   Application/Character Trait Focus: Understanding this victory gives us confidence. Christ's sacrifice provides the power for developing faithfulness, courage, and unwavering trust in God, even amidst accusation or trial.

    *   ***Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2):***
        *   *Analogy:* A King pays an impossible ransom (His own Son's life) to free slaves from a cruel tyrant, simultaneously satisfying justice (a price was paid) and showing immense love.
        *   *Courtroom Drama:* Imagine a cosmic trial. Satan presents accusations against God. The Cross is presented as Exhibit A – irrefutable evidence of God's perfect character, silencing the prosecution.

    *   ***Whiteboard Visuals:***
        *   *Keyword:* VINDICATION / PROPITIATION
        *   *Diagram:* Cross with arrows pointing to "JUSTICE" and "LOVE" – both satisfied.
        *   *Verse:* Rom 3:26 ("just and the justifier") / Heb 2:14 ("destroy... the devil")
        *   *Quote Snippet:* "...silences the bold accuser." (COL 168.3)

    *   ***Discussion Questions (Allow brief time):***
        *   *(Simple/Recall):* According to Romans 3, what did the Cross "demonstrate" about God?
        *   *(Reflection):* How does the fact that God Himself, in Christ, paid the price for our sins change how you view His Law and His love?
        *   *(Application):* When you feel accused by Satan (or your own conscience), how can remembering the victory won at the Cross give you strength and peace?

**IV. Our Response: Living in the Victory of the Cross (10 mins)** [*]
_ **A. Overcoming by the Blood and Our Testimony (Rev 12:11):**
_ Core Teaching Point: The victory won at the Cross becomes ours personally when we (1) claim the cleansing power of Christ's blood (His merits covering our sin) and (2) bear witness to His truth in our lives and words.
_ Biblical Foundation: Rev 12:11 - "They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony..." 1 John 1:7, 9 - Continual cleansing through His blood.
_ EGW Insight: "We are safe only in following where Christ leads the way... Man's business is to work in cooperation with God... We must know that the hand of Jesus Christ holds our own firmly." (HP 258.4). \* Application/Character Trait Focus: This calls for humility (recognizing our need for His blood) and courage (testifying for Him). It builds dependence on Christ, not self.

    *   **B. The Cross Empowers Character Perfection for Eternity:**
        *   Core Teaching Point: The Cross doesn't just pardon; it empowers transformation. Trusting fully in Christ's sacrifice breaks sin's hold and enables the Holy Spirit to develop His character in us, fitting us for heaven.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Gal 2:20 (Crucified with Christ, live by faith); 2 Cor 5:17 (New creation in Christ); Phil 1:6 (He who began a good work will complete it).
        *   EGW Insight: "The righteousness of Christ may be not only upon us but in our hearts and characters." (6BC 1074.4). "He desires that man... shall reach the highest possible development... He invites us to give ourselves to Him, that He may work His will in us." (SC 43.3).
        *   Application/End-Time Relevance: This character transformation IS readiness for Christ's return. Reflecting Jesus fully is the goal, made possible only through the power accessed via the Cross.

    *   ***Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1):***
        *   *Metaphor:* The Cross is like the key that unlocks the powerhouse (Holy Spirit) enabling us to live a victorious Christian life. Without the key, we remain powerless.
        *   *Analogy:* A rescued climber doesn't just celebrate being saved; they learn from the rescuer how to climb safely and strongly, becoming like their rescuer. We learn from Christ how to live His character.

    *   ***Whiteboard Visuals:***
        *   *Keyword:* OVERCOME / TRANSFORMATION
        *   *Diagram:* Cross -> Power -> Christlike Character -> Heaven
        *   *Verse:* Rev 12:11 / Gal 2:20
        *   *Question:* Daily Surrender?

    *   ***Discussion Questions (Allow brief time):***
        *   *(Simple/Observation):* According to Revelation 12:11, what are the two things the saints used to overcome Satan?
        *   *(Reflection):* Why is it essential to understand that the Cross provides power for *living* righteously, not just forgiveness for *past* sins?
        *   *(Application):* What does "working in cooperation with God" (HP 258.4) look like practically in your daily battle against sin, relying on the Cross?

**V. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)**
_ Summary: God's question, "What more could I have done?" finds its ultimate, unanswerable reply at Calvary. The Cross perfectly vindicates His justice and love, defeats Satan, and offers us complete salvation and transformation.
_ Character Focus Recap: God calls us to reflect His character of love and righteousness. The Cross is not only the standard but the _source_ of power to achieve this high calling. \* _(Whiteboard: Key Character Trait: FAITHFULNESS through His Power)_
_ Call to Action/Decision: Have you fully accepted the infinite gift offered at the Cross? Will you cease striving in your own strength and rely wholly on Christ's merits for forgiveness AND power to overcome? Choose today to surrender completely to Him.
_ _(Whiteboard: Call to Action Keyword: SURRENDER / TRUST)_ \* _(Optional Final Question):_ "What doubt or struggle will you consciously bring to the foot of the Cross this week, trusting His victory?" (Lead into prayer)
* Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The conflict is real, Christ's return is near. Let the Cross be your constant assurance and strength. "We shall know that infinite love ordered the experiences that seemed most trying... we shall rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory." (9T 286.2). He *has* done everything needed. Trust Him.
* _(Whiteboard: Final Verse Ref or Hope phrase: Phil 1:6 / "He Finishes His Work!")_
