### Introduction (Approx. 6 minutes)

*   **Objective:** Introduce the central question posed by the lesson – God's response to evil and suffering, framed by His ultimate act of love at the Cross.
*   **Opening:** Briefly touch upon the universal questions: Why does a good God allow suffering? Has God done enough?
    *   Relate to the story of Denis (Lesson Intro): Misunderstanding the king's motives led to hatred, but truth brought freedom. Similarly, misunderstanding God's actions in the Great Controversy can lead to distrust.
*   **Central Question:** Introduce Isaiah 5:4 - "What more could have been done to My vineyard that I have not done in it?" This question echoes through the history of redemption.
*   **Lesson Aim:** This week, we explore how God, through Christ and especially the Cross, definitively answers this question, demonstrating His boundless love and perfect justice, leaving nothing undone for our salvation.
*   **Memory Text:** John 18:37 (NKJV) - "Pilate therefore said to Him, ‘Are You a king then?’ Jesus answered, ‘You say rightly that I am a king. For this cause I was born, and for this cause I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.’”
    *   Connect: Jesus came to reveal the truth about God's character and kingdom, countering the lies about Him.

### Sunday: Christ the Victor (Approx. 9 minutes)

*   **Central Point:** Jesus, the true King, confronts and defeats Satan (the usurper) by revealing truth and demonstrating God's character.
*   **Bible Study:**
    *   **Satan's Roles:** Briefly list Satan's descriptions: Deceiver (Rev 12:9), Slanderer/Accuser (Rev 12:10), Usurping Ruler (John 12:31, 14:30). He misrepresents God's character and government.
        > *"[Satan] tempts men to distrust God's love and to doubt His wisdom. He is constantly seeking to excite a spirit of irreverent curiosity, a restless, inquisitive desire to penetrate the secrets of divine wisdom and power."* (PP 54.1)
    *   **Christ's Counter-Work (John 18:37):** Jesus came "to bear witness to the truth." His entire life and ministry revealed the Father's true character of love and justice, directly countering Satan's lies.
    *   **Christ's Victory:**
        *   Testifies to Truth (John 18:37).
        *   Demonstrates God's Righteousness/Love via Cross (Rom 3:25-26, 5:8). This disproves Satan's slanders (Rev 12:10-11).
        *   Will Ultimately Destroy Satan's Kingdom (Rev 12:12, Rom 16:20, Rev 11:15).
*   **Character Application:** We are in a spiritual war, but Christ has already secured the victory. Our daily choices align us with either the Victor or the defeated foe. We must actively claim Christ's victory and promises moment by moment.
    > *"The government of God is not, as Satan would make it appear, founded upon a blind submission, an unreasoning control. It appeals to the intellect and the conscience. 'Come now, and let us reason together' is the Creator's invitation..."* (SC 43.3)

### Monday: The Just and the Justifier (Approx. 9 minutes)

*   **Central Point:** The Cross is the ultimate demonstration of God's perfect justice and unfathomable love, silencing Satan's accusations against God's character and government.
*   **Bible Study:**
    *   **Undoing Satan's Work (1 John 3:8, Heb 2:14):** Jesus came specifically to destroy the devil's works and power.
    *   **God's Righteousness Revealed (Rom 3:23-26):** All have sinned. God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement (propitiation). Through faith in His blood, God demonstrates His righteousness. He is both "just and the justifier" of those who have faith in Jesus. The Cross upholds the Law while providing mercy.
    *   **God's Love Demonstrated (Rom 5:8):** "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us." The Cross is the irrefutable proof of God's love against Satan's claims that God is selfish or uncaring.
    *   **Cosmic Significance (Rev 12:10-12 cf. Gen 3:15):** The accuser is cast down "by the blood of the Lamb." The Cross was the decisive battle, exposing Satan's true character.
        > *"After the death of Jesus, 'Satan saw that his disguise was torn away. His administration was laid open before the unfallen angels and before the heavenly universe. He had revealed himself as a murderer. By shedding the blood of the Son of God, he had uprooted himself from the sympathies of the heavenly beings.'"* (DA 761.2)
        > *"The atonement of Christ is not a mere skillful way to have our sins pardoned; it is a divine remedy for the cure of transgression and the restoration of spiritual health. It is the Heaven-ordained means by which the righteousness of Christ may be not only upon us but in our hearts and characters."* (6BC 1074.6)
*   **Character Application:** Reflecting on the Cross builds confidence in God's love, even amid trials. It assures us that God is trustworthy and His ways are just, even when we don't fully understand. This understanding helps us endure suffering with faith.

### Tuesday & Wednesday: The Song of My Beloved & Christ's Parable (Approx. 10 minutes)

*   **Central Point:** God, like the vineyard owner, has done everything possible, culminating in giving His own Son, to bring forth righteousness and love in humanity.
*   **Bible Study:**
    *   **Isaiah's Song (Isa 5:1-4):**
        *   God (Beloved/Owner) established His vineyard (Israel/humanity).
        *   He did everything necessary: cleared stones, planted choice vines, built a tower, dug a winepress. Expectation: good grapes.
        *   Result: "wild grapes" (stinkfruit/worthless).
        *   **The Question (v. 4):** "What more could have been done to My vineyard That I have not done in it?" God invites judgment on His actions.
            > *"God in His Son had been seeking fruit, and had found none. Israel was a cumberer of the ground... It robbed the world of the blessings that God designed to give."* (COL 215.1)
    *   **Christ's Parable (Matt 21:33-39):**
        *   Jesus expands on Isaiah 5. Owner leases vineyard to vinedressers (leaders/humanity).
        *   Servants (prophets) sent to collect fruit are beaten and killed.
        *   **The Ultimate Act:** Owner sends his Son, believing "They will respect my son."
        *   Result: They kill the Son to seize the inheritance.
    *   **The Cross as the Answer:** What more could God do than give His Son (John 3:16)? The Cross demonstrates God did everything possible within the framework of love and free will.
        > *"Could God give us any greater proof of His love than in thus giving His Son to pass through this scene of suffering?... He requires all that it is possible for man to give. The submission on our part must be proportionate to the gift of God; it must be complete and wanting in nothing."* (3T 369.1)
    *   **God's Suffering (Isa 53:4):** "Surely He has borne our griefs And carried our sorrows." Christ, God Himself, bore the cost of sin. The pain of sin affects God most deeply.
        > *"In yielding up His precious life, Christ was not upheld by triumphant joy. All was oppressive gloom... Christ was the prince of sufferers; but His suffering was from a sense of the malignity of sin..."* (DA 752.4)
*   **Character Application:** The Cross leaves no room to doubt God's love or effort. When facing difficulties, remember the infinite price paid. This fosters gratitude and deepens our commitment, knowing God held nothing back.

### Thursday: The Vindication of God's Name [*] (Approx. 5 minutes)

*   **Central Point:** The entire plan of redemption, centered on the Cross and culminating in the judgment, serves to vindicate God's character (His name) of love and justice before the universe.
*   **Bible Study:**
    *   **God Invites Scrutiny (Isa 5:3, Rom 3:4):** God allows His actions to be judged ("That You may be justified in Your words, And may overcome when You are judged"). He is confident in His righteousness.
    *   **Universal Vindication (Rev 15:3-4, Rev 19:1-2):** At the end, all creation will acknowledge God's ways: "Just and true are Your ways, O King of the saints!" His judgments are revealed as righteous.
    *   **Why Vindication Matters:** Satan attacked God's name (character). Trust and love relationships require confidence in character. God's vindication restores universal harmony based on truth.
        > *"In the plan of redemption there must be the shedding of blood, for death must come in consequence of man's sin... And thus Christ would fully vindicate His Father's law."* (Con 21.2)
    *   **Our Role (1 Cor 6:2-3, 1 Cor 4:5):** Even the redeemed participate in the final judgment phases, reviewing God's justice and love, having all questions answered.
    *   **Ultimate Confession (Phil 2:10-11):** Every knee will bow, acknowledging Jesus is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
*   **Character Application:** Understanding that God's character will be fully vindicated gives us patience and trust now. We can rest assured that apparent injustices or unanswered questions will ultimately be resolved, revealing God's perfect love and righteousness. This strengthens our faith during perplexing times.

### Conclusion (Approx. 6 minutes)

*   **Summary:** We've explored the profound question, "What more could God have done?" The consistent answer from Scripture points to the Cross.
    *   Christ came as Victor, revealing truth and defeating Satan's lies.
    *   The Cross demonstrated God as both Just and Justifier, proving His perfect love and righteousness.
    *   The parables of the vineyard show God lavishing care, ultimately giving His Son.
    *   The entire plan vindicates God's glorious name before the universe.
*   **The Unanswered Questions:** While the Cross is the ultimate answer, mysteries remain in our finite understanding.
    > *"All that has perplexed us in the providences of God will in the world to come be made plain... Where our finite minds discovered only confusion and broken promises, we shall see the most perfect and beautiful harmony. We shall know that infinite love ordered the experiences that seemed most trying."* (9T 286.2)
*   **Character Takeaway:** The core issue is trust. Can we trust the God revealed at Calvary, even when we don't understand everything? Seeing what God *has* done gives us confidence in His love and wisdom for what we *don't* see. Our character is refined as we choose to trust Him based on the evidence of the Cross.
*   **Final Appeal:** Let the Cross settle the question in your heart. God has done everything. He loves you infinitely. Choose daily to live on the Victor's side, trusting His heart even when you cannot trace His hand. Let His love transform your character into His likeness.
    > *"We are safe only in following where Christ leads the way... If we would walk without fear, we must know that the hand of Jesus Christ holds our own firmly. And we can only know this by searching the Word of the living God."* (HP 258.4-5)
