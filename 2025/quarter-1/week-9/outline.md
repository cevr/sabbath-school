### Introduction (6 mins)

*   **Greeting & Prayer:** Welcome class, open with prayer asking for the Holy Spirit's guidance.
*   **The Central Theme:** Introduce the concept of the "Great Controversy" – the overarching conflict between Christ and Satan that forms the backdrop of all Scripture and human history. This isn't just a side story; it's the main plot.
    *   Define: What do we mean by "Cosmic Conflict" or "Great Controversy"? It's a struggle not primarily of physical force, but over God's character, His law, His government, and the allegiance of His creatures.
*   **Why It Matters:** Understanding this conflict is crucial. It helps us make sense of suffering, evil, and temptation in the world and in our own lives. It reveals the stakes involved in our choices and anchors our hope in Christ's ultimate victory.
    *   "Central to biblical theology is the great controversy between Christ and Satan." (Lesson Intro)
*   **Memory Text:** **Genesis 3:15 (NKJV):** “And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel.”
    *   This is the *protoevangelium* – the first gospel promise, given right after the fall. It encapsulates the entire conflict: enmity, two opposing sides (seed of the woman vs. seed of the serpent), struggle (bruising), and the ultimate victory of Christ (crushing the serpent's head).
*   **Lesson Goal:** Today, we will explore the biblical basis for this conflict: where it began, what it's about, and how it impacts us. Our goal is to deepen our understanding and strengthen our commitment to Christ, whose character is the standard we strive to emulate.

### Sunday: An Enemy Has Done This (9 mins) [*]

*   **The Problem:** The existence of evil in a world created by a good God. How can both be true? (Gen 1:31 - "very good"). This is a question that troubles many.
*   **Biblical Illustration:** Parable of the Wheat and Tares (Matthew 13:24-30, 37-40)
    *   **Setup:** A landowner sows good seed (v. 24). God created perfectly.
    *   **Problem:** Tares (weeds resembling wheat) appear among the good crop (vv. 25-26). Evil emerges in God's creation.
    *   **Question:** "Sir, did you not sow good seed...? How then does it have tares?" (v. 27). Where did evil come from?
    *   **Answer:** "An enemy has done this" (v. 28). Evil is not from God; it originates from an opposing force.
    *   **Identification:** Jesus explicitly identifies the players:
        *   Sower of good seed = Son of Man (Jesus) (v. 37)
        *   Field = The world (v. 38)
        *   Good seed = Children of the kingdom (v. 38)
        *   Tares = Children of the wicked one (v. 38)
        *   Enemy who sowed them = The devil (v. 39)
*   **God's Response (Why not uproot now?):** (vv. 28-30)
    *   The servants want to remove the tares immediately. Why doesn't God eradicate evil instantly?
    *   Risk of collateral damage: Uprooting tares might uproot wheat too. Premature judgment could harm the righteous or cut short opportunities for repentance.
    *   God's patience and forbearance allow time for character development and for the true nature of both good and evil to be fully revealed.
    *   "As the tares have their roots closely intertwined with those of the good grain, so false brethren in the church may be closely linked with true disciples... Were they to be separated from the church, others might be caused to stumble..." (COL 71.3)
    *   The final separation happens at the harvest (end of the age) (v. 30, 39-40).
*   **Character Connection:** This teaches us patience and forbearance, mirroring God's character. We must be cautious in judging others, recognizing that only God knows the heart (COL 71.2). However, it doesn't mean ignoring evil; we must stand for truth while trusting God's timing for ultimate justice.

### Monday & Tuesday: The Origin of the Controversy (11 mins) [*]

*   **From Earth to Heaven:** The parable shows *how* evil entered the *world*, but where did the "enemy" himself come from? Genesis 3 shows the serpent (Satan, Rev 12:9) already present and opposing God *before* the human fall. Evil existed before humanity sinned.
*   **Biblical Foundation - Lucifer's Fall:**
    *   **Ezekiel 28:12-19:** Though addressed to the King of Tyre, the description transcends any human king and points to a higher being.
        *   Original State: "seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty," "in Eden, the garden of God," "anointed cherub that covereth," "perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created" (vv. 12-15). Lucifer was a being of highest honor, created perfect by God.
        *   The Fall: "till iniquity was found in thee" (v. 15). What was the iniquity? Pride and self-exaltation. "Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness" (v. 17). His "trading" (v. 16) can also mean slander – misrepresenting God.
        *   "Sin originated with him who, next to Christ, had been most honored of God and who stood highest in power and glory among the inhabitants of heaven." (GC 493.2)
    *   **Isaiah 14:12-15:** Describes the ambition of "Lucifer, son of the morning."
        *   The Desire: "I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God... I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most High" (vv. 13-14). This was a direct challenge to God's authority and position, born of pride and a desire for self-worship.
        *   "Instead of seeking to make God supreme in the affections and allegiance of His creatures, it was Lucifer's endeavor to win their service and homage to himself." (GC 494.1)
*   **The Root Cause:** Pride, self-exaltation, coveting God's position and authority, discontent with his own exalted place. This led to misrepresenting God's character (slander) to other angels.
*   **The Mystery of Iniquity & Free Will:** How could a perfect being sin?
    *   Perfection included free moral agency – the ability to choose. Without freedom, love and allegiance would be forced and meaningless.
    *   "Sin is an intruder, for whose presence no reason can be given. It is mysterious, unaccountable; to excuse it is to defend it." (GC 492.3) God is not responsible for sin's origin. Lucifer chose rebellion.
*   **Character Connection:** The origin of sin is a stark warning against pride and self-sufficiency. Humility, gratitude, and contentment with God's place for us are essential safeguards. Recognizing our dependence on God is key to reflecting His character.

### Wednesday & Thursday: The Nature of the Conflict (10 mins)

*   **Not Just Power, but Principle:** The conflict isn't merely about who is stronger; God's omnipotence is unquestioned. It's a conflict over *character*, *truth*, and *love*. Is God just? Is His law good? Can He be trusted?
    *   "In His dealing with sin, God could employ only righteousness and truth. Satan could use what God could not—flattery and deceit." (GC 498.2)
*   **Satan's Strategy: Deception and Slander**
    *   **In Eden (Gen 3:1-5):** Questioned God's word ("Has God indeed said...?"), denied God's truth ("You will not surely die"), misrepresented God's motives ("God knows... you will be like God"). He painted God as restrictive, untruthful, and selfish.
    *   **Against God's People (Rev 12:10):** He is the "accuser of our brethren," constantly pointing out flaws and misrepresenting their motives before God.
    *   **Against Christ (Matt 4:1-11):** The temptation in the wilderness reveals the core issues:
        *   **Temptation 1 (Stones to Bread):** Questioning God's care and provision; urging self-reliance over trust. Jesus counters with Deut 8:3 – dependence on God's Word.
        *   **Temptation 2 (Temple Pinnacle):** Twisting Scripture (Ps 91:11-12) to incite presumption and test God. Jesus counters with Deut 6:16 – do not tempt God.
        *   **Temptation 3 (Worship Satan):** The ultimate goal revealed – Satan seeks the worship due only to God (v. 9). He claims authority over the world (Luke 4:6). Jesus counters with Deut 6:13 – worship and serve God alone.
    *   **Jesus' Assessment (John 8:44):** Satan "was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar and the father of it." His very nature is deception, rooted in his rebellion against the God of Truth.
*   **God's Strategy: Truth and Love**
    *   God reveals His true character through His actions, His Word, and supremely through Jesus Christ (John 14:9).
    *   Christ came to "testify to the truth" (John 18:37) and destroy the works of the devil (1 John 3:8) by living a life of perfect obedience and love, culminating in the cross.
    *   The cross exposed Satan's lies and vindicated God's character of self-sacrificing love and perfect justice. (DA 761)
*   **Character Connection:** We are involved in this battle of truth vs. error daily. Whose voice do we listen to? Whose character do we believe? Our choices reflect whether we believe Satan's lies about God or trust God's revelation of Himself. We fight not with carnal weapons, but with the "sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God" (Eph 6:17), and by developing a character aligned with Christ's.

### Conclusion & Application (9 mins)

*   **The Conflict is Real and Personal:** This cosmic struggle isn't distant history; it plays out in our world and in our hearts (Eph 6:12). Every temptation is an echo of the original conflict over loyalty to God. Every choice aligns us with either Christ or Satan.
*   **Our Part in the Vindication:** By choosing to trust and obey God, even when it's difficult, we participate in vindicating His character before the universe. Our lives become testimonies to the goodness and trustworthiness of God and the righteousness of His law. Character building *is* spiritual warfare.
*   **The Hope of Victory:** While the battle rages, the outcome is certain. Genesis 3:15 promised the crushing of the serpent's head. Christ's life, death, and resurrection secured the victory. Satan is a defeated foe (Heb 2:14).
    *   "Christ bowed His head and died, but He held fast His faith and His submission to God... Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down..." (DA 761.2, quoting Rev 12:10).
*   **Call to Faithfulness:**
    *   **Choose Your Side:** Consciously reaffirm your allegiance to Christ. Whose report will you believe?
    *   **Know the Enemy:** Be aware of Satan's tactics – doubt, discouragement, deception, accusation, appeals to pride and self.
    *   **Use Your Weapons:** Immerse yourself in Scripture, pray constantly, rely on the Holy Spirit, cultivate Christlike character (humility, love, truthfulness, obedience).
    *   **Look to Jesus:** He is our example and our strength. His victory is our assurance.
*   **Final Thought:** Understanding the Great Controversy should fill us not with fear, but with sober awareness and profound hope. It gives meaning to our struggles and motivates us to live lives that honor our victorious King, hastening the day when sin and Satan will be no more. Let us strive daily to reflect the character of Him who loved us and gave Himself for us.
*   **Closing Prayer:** Pray for strength to stand firm in the conflict, for discernment to recognize truth from error, and for grace to develop characters that reflect Jesus, our Commander.
