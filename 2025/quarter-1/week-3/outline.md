**I. Introduction: Can We Truly Please God? (5-7 minutes)**

*   **Hook:** Begin with the Father's Day gift analogy from the lesson introduction (p. 20). Ask: How does this contrast with how our Heavenly Father views us and our feeble efforts?
*   **The Core Question:** Can we, as fallen, sinful beings, actually be *pleasing* to a holy God? It seems impossible from a human standpoint.
*   **Memory Text:** "The LORD your God in your midst, the Mighty One, will save; He will rejoice over you with gladness, He will quiet you with His love, He will rejoice over you with singing" (Zephaniah 3:17, NKJV).
    *   This text reveals God's heart *towards* His people – not condemnation, but saving love and joyful delight.
*   **Lesson Goal:** This week, we explore the incredible truth that God *does* value us infinitely, He *delights* in His children, and through the merits of Jesus Christ, we *can* live lives that are pleasing in His sight. This understanding is vital for character development and readiness for His coming.
*   **EGW:** "It is the glory of the gospel that it is founded upon the principle of restoring in the fallen race the divine image by a constant manifestation of benevolence." (CH 222.1) God's goal is restoration, not just acquittal.

**II. More Valuable Than You Can Imagine (10 minutes)**

*   **Sunday - God's Compassionate Pursuit**
*   **Central Point:** God sees immense value in every soul, demonstrated powerfully in the parable of the Prodigal Son.
*   **Bible Study:** Luke 15:11-32
    *   **(v. 11-19):** The son's rejection, degradation, and realization of need. He saw himself as worthless, fit only to be a servant.
    *   **(v. 20):** The Father's reaction: "But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him." This is undignified haste driven by overwhelming love and value for the son.
    *   **(v. 21-24):** Full restoration, celebration – signifying God's joy over one repentant sinner.
    *   **(v. 25-32):** The elder brother's reaction – represents self-righteousness, misunderstanding the Father's heart, focusing on works, not relationship. A warning to those "in the church."
*   **EGW Insight:**
    *   "Arise and go to your Father. He will meet you a great way off. If you take even one step toward Him in repentance, He will hasten to enfold you in His arms of infinite love." (COL 206.1)
    *   "The man who attempts to keep the commandments of God from a sense of obligation merely... will never enter into the joy of obedience... True obedience is the outworking of a principle within. It springs from the love of righteousness, the love of the law of God." (COL 97.4) Contrast with the elder brother.
*   **Character Application:** Do we grasp our value to God, even in our sinfulness? Do we see others through His eyes? Are we harboring an "elder brother" spirit, focused on our performance rather than the Father's love and grace? God's love motivates true obedience.

**III. Rejoicing With Gladness (8 minutes)**

*   **Monday & Tuesday - God's Delight in His People**
*   **Central Point:** God doesn't just tolerate us; He actively delights and rejoices over His redeemed people when they walk in His ways.
*   **Bible Study:**
    *   **Zephaniah 3:17:** God rejoices, quiets with love, sings over His people. This is active, emotional delight.
    *   **Isaiah 43:4:** "Since you were precious in My sight, You have been honored, And I have loved you..."
    *   **Psalm 149:4:** "For the LORD takes pleasure in His people; He will beautify the humble with salvation."
    *   **Proverbs 15:8-9:** Contrast: Wickedness is an abomination, but "the prayer of the upright is His delight," and "He loves him who follows righteousness." God delights in character reflecting His own.
    *   **Ephesians 5:25-28:** Christ's love for the church is the model – sacrificial, cleansing, cherishing. This reflects God's deep, loving investment.
*   **EGW Insight:**
    *   "As the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee... And heaven and earth shall unite in the Father's song of rejoicing: 'For this My son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.'" (COL 207.1)
    *   "What is needed in this, our time of danger, is fervent prayer... Let everyone bear in mind that God delights to listen to the supplications of His people..." (2SM 372.3)
*   **Character Application:** Understanding God's delight motivates us. It's not about earning favor, but responding to His love. Does the knowledge that God *rejoices* over righteousness inspire us to pursue it more earnestly?

**IV. The Only Way: Pleasing God Through Christ and Faith (10 minutes)**

*   **Wednesday & Thursday - The Foundation of Acceptance**
*   **Central Point:** Fallen humanity cannot please God through its own efforts. Acceptance and the ability to please God come *only* through faith in Jesus Christ and His mediating work.
*   **Bible Study:**
    *   **Romans 5:8:** "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us." His love and provision came *first*.
    *   **Romans 8:1:** "There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus..." Our standing is based on Him.
    *   **Hebrews 11:6:** "But without faith it is impossible to please Him..." Faith is the essential channel.
    *   **1 Peter 2:4-6:** We come to Christ, the Living Stone, and become living stones, offering "spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God *through Jesus Christ*."
    *   **Mark 9:17-29:** The father's cry: "Lord, I believe; help my unbelief!" (v. 24). Jesus didn't demand perfect faith, but honored the desperate plea directed towards Him. Even weak faith, fixed on Christ, is accepted.
*   **EGW Insight:**
    *   "Without God's intervention, fallen people are incapable of bringing anything valuable to God. Yet God, in His grace and mercy, has made a way, through the work of Christ." (Lesson paraphrase based on 7BC 924, SD 53).
    *   "The word that was spoken to Jesus at the Jordan, 'This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased,' embraces humanity... With all our sins and weaknesses, we are not cast aside as worthless. 'He hath made us accepted in the Beloved.' Ephesians 1:6." (DA 113.1)
    *   "It is faith that connects us with heaven, and brings us strength for coping with the powers of darkness... Let these souls, in their helpless unworthiness, cast themselves upon the mercy of their compassionate Saviour... You can never perish while you do this—never." (DA 429.1)
*   **Character Application:** We must abandon self-reliance. Our efforts, prayers, and acts of service are pleasing *only* as they are offered by faith through Christ. This brings humility and constant dependence on Him. Do we truly rely on Christ's merits alone?

**V. A Worthy Goal: Living a Pleasing Life [*] (5 minutes)**

*   **Thursday & Friday - Obedience from the Heart**
*   **Central Point:** While justification is by faith alone, the result of true faith is a transformed life aimed at pleasing God through heartfelt obedience and love.
*   **Bible Study:**
    *   **2 Corinthians 5:9:** "Therefore we make it our aim... to be well pleasing to Him." This becomes the believer's goal.
    *   **Hebrews 13:21:** God works *in us* "what is well pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ..." It's His work enabling our pleasing actions.
    *   **Romans 12:10-13:** Practical outworking: brotherly love, diligence, fervency, prayer, hospitality. Love in action.
*   **EGW Insight:**
    *   "All true obedience comes from the heart. It was heart work with Christ. And if we consent, He will so identify Himself with our thoughts and aims, so blend our hearts and minds into conformity to His will, that when obeying Him we shall be but carrying out our own impulses. The will, refined and sanctified, will find its highest delight in doing His service." (DA 668.3)
    *   "Stand like Daniel... Do not disappoint Him who so loved you that He gave His own life to cancel your sins... If you have made mistakes, you certainly gain a victory if you see these mistakes and regard them as beacons of warning. Thus you turn defeat into victory..." (COL 332.3)
*   **Character Application:** Pleasing God is not a burden, but the natural outflow of a heart transformed by His love and grace. It involves actively seeking to live according to His will, empowered by His Spirit. This is the essence of character building – becoming like Jesus.

**VI. Conclusion (5-8 minutes)**

*   **Recap:** We began asking if we can please God. The answer is a resounding YES, but only through Christ. God values us infinitely (Prodigal Son), He delights in His people (Zephaniah), He accepts us through Christ's merits by faith (Romans, Hebrews), even imperfect faith (Mark 9), and He empowers us to live lives of loving obedience that are truly pleasing to Him (DA 668).
*   **Hope & Urgency:** What amazing hope this gives us! We are not worthless, but precious. We are not striving alone, but accepted and empowered. Christ is our Mediator, making our flawed offerings acceptable.
*   **Final Charge:** Let us embrace our value in God's eyes. Let us rest in Christ's acceptance. Let us, by faith, make it our highest aim to please Him, allowing His Spirit to transform our characters into His likeness. This is our preparation for His soon return.
*   **Closing Thought:** "When we know God as it is our privilege to know Him, our life will be a life of continual obedience. Through an appreciation of the character of Christ, through communion with God, sin will become hateful to us." (DA 668.4) May this be our experience.
