**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

**I. Introduction (5-7 mins)**
    *   Hook: Imagine the most precious, valuable object you can think of. Now, consider this: God values *you* infinitely more, even in our fallen state. How can this be?
    *   Theme Introduction: Today we explore a profound truth: God, the Holy One, not only loves us but *delights* in us, His children, when we are connected to Him through Christ. Our theme is **Reflecting the Father's Unfathomable Love: Our True Worth and Faithful Response in Christ.** Understanding this depth changes everything.
        *   *(Whiteboard: Write Main Theme Title: Reflecting the Father's Love)*
    *   Connection to Character/Eternity: Grasping our value and God's delight isn't just comforting; it's foundational for building the Christ-like character needed to stand firm in these last days and live eternally with Him.
    *   Roadmap: We'll explore (1) God's astonishing view of our worth, (2) How we, as sinners, can actually please Him, and (3) The loving response this calls forth from our hearts.

**II. The Father's Heart: Seeing Our Infinite Worth (12-15 mins)**
    *   **A. God's Unconditional Regard & Joy:**
        *   Core Teaching Point: Despite our sin and unworthiness, God sees us with infinite love and potential, valuing us beyond measure, like the father longing for his lost son.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Luke 15:20-24 - The father *ran* (undignified, eager love!), kissed, restored fully. He didn't wait for perfect repentance, just the turning towards home. Zephaniah 3:17 - God rejoices over us *with singing*! He is *in our midst*, quieting us with His love.
        *   EGW Insight: "God regards us as His children... He invites us to trust in Him with a trust deeper and stronger than that of a child in his earthly father... the love of God is larger, broader, deeper, than human love can possibly be. It is immeasurable." (COL 141, 142). He sees us according to the price paid (DA 668.1).
        *   Application/Problem Tackled: We often feel worthless due to sin/failures. God's view is based on His love and Christ's sacrifice, not our performance.

    *   **B. Valued Enough to Redeem:** [*]
        *   Core Teaching Point: Our value is proven by the infinite price Heaven paid – the life of God's own Son.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Isaiah 43:4 - "Since you were precious in My sight... I have loved you; Therefore I will give men for you, And people for your life." Romans 5:8 - "While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."
        *   EGW Insight: "God wanted them, else He would not have sent His Son on such an expensive errand to redeem them." (DA 668.1). "With Christ He gave all the resources of heaven..." (CH 222.2).
        *   Application/Obstacles to Depth: Satan constantly tries to make us doubt God's love and our value. We must cling to the evidence of the Cross.

    *   ***Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2):***
        *   *Analogy:* A master artist sees immense value in a damaged painting, not because of the damage, but because of the original design and potential for restoration. God sees His image, marred but restorable, in us.
        *   *Hypothetical:* Imagine finding a lost child. Your overwhelming emotion isn't judgment, but relief and joy. Magnify that infinitely – that's a glimpse of God's joy over one returning soul (Luke 15:7).

    *   ***Whiteboard Visuals:***
        *   *Keyword:* VALUE / PRECIOUS
        *   *Diagram:* Father running -> Son (Luke 15)
        *   *Verse:* Zeph 3:17 ("Rejoice over you with singing")
        *   *Quote Snippet:* "...price He has placed upon them." (DA 668.1)

    *   ***Discussion Questions (Allow brief time):***
        *   *(Simple/Observation):* "In the Prodigal Son story (Luke 15), what specific actions show the father's great love and acceptance?"
        *   *(Reflection):* "Why is it sometimes hard for us to truly believe God delights in us, as Zephaniah 3:17 says?"
        *   *(Application):* "How does remembering the 'expensive errand' of the Cross help you combat feelings of worthlessness this week?"

**III. Pleasing God: The Pathway of Faith Through Christ (12-15 mins)**
    *   **A. The Impossibility Alone, The Possibility in Christ:**
        *   Core Teaching Point: On our own, our best efforts are tainted by sin and cannot please a holy God. But through Christ's perfect life and sacrifice, credited to us by faith, we become acceptable and pleasing to Him.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Hebrews 11:6 - "Without faith it is impossible to please Him." 1 Peter 2:5 - We offer "spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God *through Jesus Christ*." Romans 8:1 - "There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are *in Christ Jesus*."
        *   EGW Insight: "With all our sins and weaknesses, we are not cast aside as worthless. 'He hath made us accepted in the Beloved.' Ephesians 1:6. The glory that rested upon Christ is a pledge of the love of God for us." (DA 113.1).
        *   Application/Problem Tackled: The feeling of "not being good enough" for God. The solution isn't trying harder in our own strength, but trusting fully in Christ's sufficiency.

    *   **B. Faith That Connects, Even When Imperfect:** [*]
        *   Core Teaching Point: Pleasing faith isn't about quantity or perfection, but about its object: Christ. Even weak faith, reaching out to Him, connects us to His power and righteousness.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Mark 9:24 - The desperate father cried, "Lord, I believe; help my unbelief!" Jesus honored this struggling faith.
        *   EGW Insight: "Let these souls, in their helpless unworthiness, cast themselves upon the mercy of their compassionate Saviour. Look not to self, but to Christ... Faith comes by the word of God. Then grasp His promise... Cast yourself at His feet with the cry, 'Lord, I believe; help Thou mine unbelief.' You can never perish while you do this—never." (DA 428, 429).
        *   Application/Obstacles to Depth: Discouragement over weak faith or persistent struggles. The key is *where* our faith is placed, not how strong it feels.

    *   ***Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2):***
        *   *Analogy:* A small child brings a scribbled drawing or a wilted flower as a gift. A loving parent doesn't critique the imperfection but cherishes the love and trust behind the gift. God accepts our faith-offerings through Christ similarly.
        *   *Metaphor:* Faith is the hand that reaches out to grasp the lifeline (Christ) thrown to us. Even a trembling hand that grasps the rope is saved.

        *   *Keyword:* FAITH / ACCEPTED IN CHRIST

        *   *Verse:* Heb 11:6a ("Without faith...") / 1 Pet 2:5b ("...acceptable... through Jesus Christ")
        *   *Quote Snippet:* "Help my unbelief!" (Mark 9:24)

    *   ***Discussion Questions (Allow brief time):***
        *   *(Simple/Recall):* "According to 1 Peter 2:5, how do our spiritual sacrifices become acceptable to God?" (Through Jesus Christ)
        *   *(Reflection):* "What encouragement can we take from the story of the father with the demon-possessed son (Mark 9) about the kind of faith God accepts?"
        *   *(Application):* "When you feel your faith is weak, what practical step can you take, based on these verses and insights, to connect with Christ's strength?"

**IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)**
    *   Summary: We've seen God's incredible love and delight in us, not because of who we are, but because of His grace and who Christ is. We are precious in His sight! We can please Him, not by works, but by faith connecting us to Jesus.
    *   Character Focus Recap: This understanding transforms us! Knowing we are loved and accepted frees us to obey, not out of fear or duty, but out of love. This is the heart of true character development – reflecting the Father's love.
        *   *(Whiteboard: Key Character Trait: LOVING OBEDIENCE)*

    *   ***Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2):***
        *   *Analogy:* Think of receiving an incredibly generous, unexpected gift. Your natural response isn't obligation, but overwhelming gratitude that *wants* to express itself. Knowing God's love and acceptance in Christ should evoke a similar heart-response of loving obedience.
        *   *Story Snippet (Ref DA 668.4):* Briefly mention how Christ's own will was perfectly aligned with the Father's. When we consent, He works in us so that *doing His will* becomes our *highest delight*, not a burden. It's like wanting what He wants.

    *   ***Whiteboard Visuals:***
        *   *Keyword:* RESPONSE / TRUST
        *   *Diagram:* Heart -> Loving Obedience
        *   *Verse:* 2 Cor 5:9 ("well pleasing to Him")
        *   *Quote Snippet:* "...highest delight in doing His service." (DA 668.4)

    *   ***Discussion Questions (Allow brief time):***
        *   *(Simple/Recall):* "What is the key difference between obeying God out of fear versus obeying Him out of love, based on our discussion?"
        *   *(Reflection):* "How does truly believing you are 'accepted in the Beloved' (Eph 1:6) change your motivation for living a godly life?"
        *   *(Application/Forward-Looking):* "Thinking about the week ahead, what is one practical way you can remind yourself of your value to God when you face challenges or temptations?"

    *   Call to Action/Decision: Will you accept your value in God's eyes today? Will you choose to place your trust, even imperfect trust, fully in Christ, allowing His love to motivate your life? Let's aim "to be well pleasing to Him" (2 Cor 5:9) out of gratitude.
    *   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: "All true obedience comes from the heart... if we consent, He will so identify Himself with our thoughts and aims... that when obeying Him we shall be but carrying out our own impulses. The will, refined and sanctified, will find its highest delight in doing His service." (DA 668.4). Let us consent today, for He is coming soon!
        *   *(Whiteboard: Final Verse Ref or Hope phrase: Rev 22:12 / "Accepted in the Beloved!")*
