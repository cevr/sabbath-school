# Revised Outline: 2024 Q1 W1 - God Loves Freely
## Lesson 1: God Loves Freely
- **Central Theme:** God's love is a free, unearned, initiating, and transforming gift, rooted in His character, demonstrated supremely at the Cross, and calling for our wholehearted response.

**(0-5 minutes) Introduction: The Defining Question**

*   **Hook:** Recall Peter's denial and Christ's searching question by the sea: "Do you love Me?" (John 21:15-17). This question echoes through time to each of us.
*   **EGW Insight:** "This heart-searching question was necessary... The work of restoration can never be thorough unless the roots of evil are reached." (5BC 1151.4) Our response defines our relationship with God.
*   **Lesson Focus:** Before we answer, we must grasp the foundation: God's love for *us*. It's not earned; it's given *freely*.
*   **Memory Text:** Hosea 14:4 (NKJV): “I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely, for My anger has turned away from him.” This is God's promise of initiating, restorative love.
*   **Objective:** To grasp the nature of God's free love and how it empowers transformation and invites our loving response.

**(5-13 minutes) Sunday: Love Beyond Merit - Grace for the Unworthy**

*   **Core Idea:** God's love isn't based on our worthiness but flows freely from His sovereign character, even when we deserve judgment.
*   **Key Scripture:** Exodus 33:19 (Context: Post-Golden Calf Apostasy)
    *   Moses asks to see God's glory (v. 18).
    *   God's Response: "I will make all My goodness pass before you... I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion."
    *   **Meaning:** Facing Israel's blatant sin, God asserts His *freedom* to show mercy. It's not arbitrary favoritism but His sovereign choice, as Creator, to extend grace when justice could demand otherwise. He *chooses* love.
    *   EGW: God reveals His character to draw us: "He sent His Son into the world to manifest... the nature and the attributes of the invisible God." (MH 419.3)
*   **Application & Transformation:**
    *   **Challenge:** We project human conditions onto God (love must be earned). We feel unworthy.
    *   **Truth:** God's love originates in *His* unchanging character, not our fluctuating performance. He loves freely. This frees us from both pride (thinking we earned it) and despair (thinking we're too unworthy).
    *   **Metaphor:** A Master Artist finds a discarded, broken piece of pottery. By all standards, it's useless. Yet, the Artist, seeing potential only He understands, freely chooses to meticulously restore it, not because the pottery deserved it, but because the Artist *is* a restorer, full of grace and vision. God sees us through the lens of His restorative love.

**(13-21 minutes) Monday: Love Despite Rejection - Faithfulness to the Unfaithful**

*   **Core Idea:** God's love remains steadfast and pursues us even when we are unfaithful and reject Him, like a devoted spouse yearning for reconciliation.
*   **Key Scripture:** Hosea 1:2; 14:4
    *   (1:2) Hosea marries Gomer ("a wife of harlotry") – a living parable of Israel's spiritual adultery against God.
    *   (14:4) After cycles of unfaithfulness, God promises: "I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely (*nedabah*)."
    *   **Meaning:** *Nedabah* means voluntary, spontaneous, generous – like a "freewill offering" (Lev 22:18). God's love isn't forced or grudging; it flows willingly from His heart, even when spurned.
    *   EGW: God's persistent love: "The Lord did not give Israel up without first doing all that could be done to lead them back..." (PK 107.1)
*   **Application & Transformation:**
    *   **Challenge:** Viewing God as easily angered, distant when we fail. Feeling alienated by sin.
    *   **Truth:** God is the grieved Father/Spouse whose love persists (SC 21.2). His heart aches for our return. This builds trust and motivates repentance born from love, not just fear.
    *   **Analogy:** Imagine a spring high in the mountains, pure and constantly flowing. People downstream may choose to pollute the water or divert its course, but the spring itself continues to pour forth its pure water freely, inherently driven to give life. God's love is that ever-flowing, pure source, unaffected in its essence by our reception of it.

**(21-28 minutes) Tuesday: Love as Source - The Uncaused Cause**

*   **Core Idea:** God's love is intrinsic to His being. He didn't *need* to create or redeem; He *chose* to out of His self-giving nature. Love is who He is.
*   **Key Scriptures:**
    *   Revelation 4:11: "You created all things, And by Your will they exist..." Creation stemmed from His free will, an expression of His nature.
    *   John 17:24: "...You loved Me before the foundation of the world." Love existed eternally within the Godhead. God *is* love (1 John 4:8).
    *   Hebrews 1:3: "...upholding all things by the word of His power." His sustaining power is an act of ongoing, free love.
    *   EGW: Redemption planned freely: "Before the foundations of the earth were laid, the Father and the Son had united in a covenant to redeem man..." (Lift Him Up 103.2) It was a voluntary pact of love.
*   **Application & Transformation:**
    *   **Challenge:** Taking existence, life, and God's love for granted. A subtle sense of entitlement.
    *   **Truth:** Everything is a gift flowing from God's free love. He owes us nothing; He gives us everything. This fosters deep gratitude and humility.
    *   **Practice:** Cultivate daily awareness: Thank God not just for blessings, but for the fundamental gift of existence and His sustaining love, freely given before we ever drew breath or sinned.

**(28-37 minutes) Wednesday/Thursday: Love's Invitation & Ultimate Cost**

*   **Core Idea:** God freely invites all into His love, demonstrated supremely in Christ's voluntary sacrifice, but He honors our freedom to accept or reject the invitation and its provision.
*   **Key Scriptures & Concepts:**
    *   **The Invitation:** Matthew 22:1-14 (Parable of Wedding Banquet)
        *   King (God) invites widely (v. 2-3, 8-10) – God's call is universal and free.
        *   Many refuse or are unprepared (v. 3, 11-13). Acceptance requires receiving the King's provision (the wedding garment = Christ's righteousness).
        *   "Many are called, but few are chosen" (v. 14) – The "chosen" freely accept the invitation *and* the provided righteousness. EGW: Wearing the garment means accepting Christ (UL 304.4).
    *   **God's Desire vs. Our Will:** Matthew 23:37 ("...how often I wanted to gather you... but you were not willing!"). God desires all, but respects our choice.
    *   **The Voluntary Cost:** John 10:18 ("No one takes it [My life] from Me, but I lay it down of Myself."). Christ's sacrifice was entirely free will, the ultimate act of love. Galatians 2:20 ("...loved me and gave Himself for me").
    *   EGW: The Cross expresses infinite love: "Nothing less than the infinite sacrifice... could express the Father's love..." (SC 14.1). It was planned from eternity (DA 22.2).
*   **Application & Transformation:**
    *   **Challenge:** Indifference to God's call; self-righteousness (trying to make our own garment); rejecting the free gift.
    *   **Truth:** Recognize the infinite value of God's invitation, purchased by Christ's voluntary death. Humbly accept His free gift of salvation and righteousness. True love requires freedom on both sides.
    *   **Action:** Daily choose to "put on the Lord Jesus Christ" (Rom 13:14), accepting His righteousness and letting His love motivate our response.

**(37-45 minutes) Conclusion: Responding to God's Free Love**

*   **Summary:** God's love is free, sovereign, persistent, and the source of all. It reaches the unworthy, pursues the unfaithful, invites all, and paid the ultimate price voluntarily on the Cross.
*   **The Question Revisited:** Knowing this immense, free love, how do we answer Christ: "Do you love Me?" Our love isn't payment, but a grateful *response* (1 John 4:19).
*   **God's Goal:** His free love aims to restore us into His image (COL 415.4). Accepting His love is transformative.
    *   EGW: The depth of His love: "The heart of God yearns over His earthly children with a love stronger than death. In giving up His Son, He has poured out to us all heaven in one gift." (SC 21.2) Let this truth reshape us.
*   **Call to Action:**
    1.  **Receive:** Have you personally accepted God's free gift of love and Christ's righteousness? Stop trying to earn it; simply receive it today.
    2.  **Reflect:** How can we mirror this free, unconditional love to others this week? Let His light shine through "words of truth and deeds of holiness." (COL 416.1)
    3.  **Reveal:** Share this vital message of God's free love – the revelation of His character – with urgency in a world needing hope (COL 415.5).
*   **Closing Prayer:** Pray for a profound personal revelation of God's free love, the grace to respond with wholehearted devotion, and the empowerment to reflect His character faithfully.
