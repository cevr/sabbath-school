### Introduction (Approx. 6 min)

*   **Opening Thought:** We sometimes hear discussions contrasting God's law with His love or grace, as if they are opposing forces. The lesson introduction mentions a church board member saying, "We can't make decisions based on compassion." This highlights a potential misunderstanding. Is God's law separate from His love? Is compassion somehow contrary to His requirements?
*   **Central Point:** This week, we explore the profound truth that God's law is not contrary to love; rather, love is the very foundation, motivation, and fulfillment of the law. The law is a transcript of the character of a God who *is* love (1 John 4:8).
*   **Memory Text:** "Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the law" (Romans 13:8, NKJV). This text encapsulates our study – love isn't an alternative to the law; it *is* the fulfilling of it.
*   **Objective:** To understand the inseparable unity of God's law and His love, recognizing that true obedience springs from a heart transformed by grace, leading to a character reflecting Jesus Christ and preparing us for His soon return.

### The Law: A Transcript of Love (Approx. 10 min)

*   **Biblical Foundation:**
    *   **Exodus 20:1-17:** The Ten Commandments. Notice the context: Given *after* deliverance from Egypt (Exod 20:2), rooted in God's loving, redemptive action. It's a covenant framework for relationship.
    *   **Matthew 22:37-40:** Jesus summarizes the entire Law and Prophets with two commands: Love God supremely and love your neighbor as yourself. This reveals the core principle underlying all commandments.
*   **Speaking Points:**
    *   The law isn't merely a list of rules but an expression of divine love, outlining how loving relationships work – with God (first four commandments) and with others (last six).
    *   These principles existed from Eden, governing relationships based on love. They were codified at Sinai for a people often "blinded by transgression" (1BC 1104.3).
    *   God's law is a "transcript of His character" (COL 305.2). Since God is love, His law must be the law of love.
    *   It embodies the "principles of His kingdom" (COL 305.2).
    *   Jesus taught the law is a "divine whole" (DA 607.4). Breaking one part violates the underlying principle of love. You cannot truly love God while hating your neighbor, nor truly love your neighbor without acknowledging God.
*   **EGW Insights:**
    *   "The law of Jehovah dating back to creation, was comprised in the two great principles..." (1BC 1104.3).
    *   "Our Lord presents the first four and the last six commandments as a divine whole, and teaches that love to God will be shown by obedience to all His commandments." (DA 607.4).
*   **Character Connection:**
    *   **Problem:** Viewing the law as burdensome, external restrictions.
    *   **Solution:** Understanding the law as God's loving design for our flourishing and right relationships. Obedience becomes a response of love, not fearful duty. This aligns our character with God's design.

### The Law's Role After the Cross (Approx. 10 min)

*   **Problem/Need:** A common misconception is that Christ's sacrifice abolished the law, or that grace makes obedience unnecessary.
*   **Biblical Foundation:**
    *   **Romans 7:7, 12:** Paul asks, "Is the law sin?" "Certainly not!" Instead, the law reveals sin. It shows us our condition. The law itself is "holy, and the commandment holy and just and good."
    *   **Romans 3:31:** "Do we then make void the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we establish the law." Faith in Christ doesn't discard the law but upholds its righteousness and purpose.
    *   **Matthew 5:17-18:** Jesus explicitly stated He came not to destroy the law but to fulfill it. Not one jot or tittle will pass away until all is fulfilled.
    *   **Galatians 3:24:** The law acts as a "schoolmaster" (tutor/guardian) to bring us to Christ, showing our need for His righteousness.
*   **Speaking Points:**
    *   The law functions like a mirror (James 1:23-25). It shows us the dirt (sin) but cannot clean us. It reveals our desperate need for a Saviour.
    *   Christ's death didn't abolish the standard of righteousness; it met the law's demands for justice against sin while offering mercy. He "vindicated" the law (FE 331.2).
    *   Redemption confirms the law's unchanging nature, reflecting God's character.
    *   Obedience after conversion isn't to *earn* salvation but is the natural result of love and gratitude toward the One who saved us.
*   **EGW Insights:**
    *   "As the sinner looks into the great moral looking glass, he sees his defects of character... But he knows that the law cannot in any way remove the guilt or pardon the transgressor. He must go farther than this. The law is but the schoolmaster to bring him to Christ." (1SM 213.2-3).
    *   "Sin did not kill the law, but it did kill the carnal mind in Paul..." (1SM 213.1). The law exposes the sinfulness inherent in the unrenewed heart.
*   **Character Connection:** The law serves a vital role in character development by humbling us, revealing our sinfulness, driving us to Christ for forgiveness and power, and then guiding our transformed lives in paths of righteousness out of love. "If you love Me, you will keep My commandments" (John 14:15, NASB).

### Law Written on the Heart: Grace and Obedience (Approx. 8 min) [*]

*   **Problem/Need:** We are naturally sinful and cannot keep God's law perfectly in our own strength (Romans 8:7). How is true obedience possible?
*   **Biblical Foundation:**
    *   **Jeremiah 31:31-34; Hebrews 8:10:** The New Covenant promise: "I will put My laws in their mind and write them on their hearts." This is an internal transformation wrought by the Holy Spirit.
    *   **Ezekiel 36:26-27:** God promises a new heart and a new spirit, causing us to walk in His statutes.
    *   **Ephesians 2:8-10:** "For by grace you have been saved through faith... not of works... For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works." Salvation is a gift received by faith; good works are the *result*, not the cause.
    *   **John 3:3-7:** The necessity of the new birth – a spiritual heart transplant.
*   **Speaking Points:**
    *   The law cannot change the heart, but God's grace *can*.
    *   True obedience isn't just external conformity but an internal principle of love shaping the life from within.
    *   We must avoid two errors:
        1.  **Legalism:** Trying to earn salvation or become holy through our own works (SC 59.2).
        2.  **Antinomianism:** Believing that faith in Christ frees us from the obligation to obey God's law (SC 60.1).
    *   Faith and grace *enable* obedience; they don't negate it.
*   **EGW Insights:**
    *   "Grace means favor to one who is undeserving, to one who is lost." (1SM 347.1).
    *   "Obedience—the service and allegiance of love—is the true sign of discipleship... Instead of releasing man from obedience, it is faith, and faith only, that makes us partakers of the grace of Christ, which enables us to render obedience." (SC 60.2).
    *   "When the law of God is written in the heart it will be exhibited in a pure and holy life." (TDWG 146.2).
*   **Character Connection:** God's goal is the restoration of His image in us. Through grace, He transforms our hearts, writing His law of love within us. This internal change naturally leads to outward obedience that reflects the character of Christ.

### Love in Action: Fulfilling the Law (Approx. 5 min) [*]

*   **Problem/Need:** Is fulfilling the law merely about avoiding prohibited actions (sins of commission)?
*   **Biblical Foundation:**
    *   **Romans 13:8-10; Galatians 5:14:** Love *is* the fulfillment of the law. It encompasses all the commandments relating to our neighbor.
    *   **Matthew 23:23-24:** Jesus condemned the Pharisees for meticulously tithing herbs while neglecting the "weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith." He clarified, "These you ought to have done, without leaving the others undone." True obedience integrates both the letter and the spirit.
    *   **Isaiah 58:6-14:** God defines true fasting and true Sabbath-keeping not just as ritual observance or personal pleasure, but as acts of love: loosing bonds of wickedness, feeding the hungry, housing the poor, clothing the naked, relieving the oppressed. This is calling the Sabbath a "delight."
    *   **James 2:1-9:** Condemns showing partiality based on wealth, calling it a violation of the "royal law according to the Scripture, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'"
*   **Speaking Points:**
    *   Love fulfills the law not just by refraining from harm (negative commands), but by actively doing good (positive actions).
    *   This includes pursuing justice, showing mercy, and living faithfully.
    *   The Sabbath itself, grounded in creation and deliverance (Deut 5:12-15), finds its true delight when connected with acts of love and compassion for others.
    *   We must beware of sins of omission – failing to do the good that love requires.
*   **EGW Insights:**
    *   "The sin which is indulged to the greatest extent... is selfishness. There can be no returning to the Lord except by self-denial... We should forget self in the desire to do good to others." (2T 132.2-3).
    *   "To all who receive the Sabbath as a sign of Christ's creative and redeeming power, it will be a delight. Seeing Christ in it, they delight themselves in Him." This delight connects to His invitation to rest and His works of love. (DA 288.4, 289.1).
    *   We are to copy Christ's pattern: "He went about doing good." (OHC 180.3).
*   **Character Connection:** A Christlike character is demonstrated not just by what we *don't* do, but by what we *do* out of love for God and others. Actively pursuing justice and mercy is integral to fulfilling the law of love.

### Conclusion (Approx. 6 min)

*   **Summary:** We've seen that God's law and His love are inseparable. The law reveals His loving character and our need for His grace. Christ's sacrifice upholds the law while providing the grace that transforms our hearts. The Holy Spirit writes the law of love within us, enabling an obedience that flows from gratitude. This love fulfills the law not just by avoiding evil, but by actively doing good – pursuing justice and showing mercy.
*   **Character Focus & Call to Action:** The most important work is character building – becoming like Jesus. Is the law being written on *our* hearts? Is love—love for God and love for others—our primary motivation? Let's examine our lives this week:
    *   Are we merely avoiding sin, or are we actively seeking opportunities to show God's love through acts of kindness, justice, and mercy, as highlighted in Isaiah 58 and James 2?
    *   How can we, individually and as a church community, better reflect God's concern for the poor, the oppressed, the needy, fulfilling the "weightier matters"?
*   **Final Appeal:** True obedience is the "service and allegiance of love" (SC 60.2). This love, born from experiencing God's love through Christ, is what truly fulfills the law. As Ellen White stated, "when we love the world as He has loved it, then for us His mission is accomplished. We are fitted for heaven; for we have heaven in our hearts" (DA 641.3). Let us embrace this transforming love, live out the principles of His law daily, and reflect His character to a world in desperate need, hastening the day of His glorious return.
