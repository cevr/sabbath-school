### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: "We often hear 'Just love' vs. 'Keep the commandments.' Are these opposed? Or is there a deeper connection vital for our salvation and readiness?"
-   Theme Introduction: State the **profound** theme: Perfect Love is the very transcript of God's character, the fulfillment of His Law, and the goal of our sanctification. This isn't mere sentiment; it's the bedrock of eternal fitness.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Write Main Theme Title: Perfect Love: Fulfilling the Law, Reflecting God)*
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: Link this perfect love directly to the character God requires (Matt 5:48) and our preparation to meet Jesus face-to-face. It's about becoming like Him.
-   Roadmap: Briefly outline: 1. Law as Love's Foundation (God's Character), 2. Law's Purpose Now (Revealing Need), 3. Grace Empowering Love & Obedience, 4. Active Love as Evidence of Readiness.

### II. The Law: Love's Foundation & God's Character ({Estimated Time} 8-10 mins)
-   **A. The Law as a Transcript of God's Character:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: God's Law isn't arbitrary rules, but the very expression of His unchanging character of love, holiness, and righteousness.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Exodus 20:1-17 (The Commandments); Matthew 22:37-40 (Jesus summarizes as Love); Leviticus 19:2 ("Be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy").
        -   The first four commandments show love to God; the last six show love to man. They are inseparable aspects of God's nature.
    -   EGW Insight: "God's law is the transcript of His character. It embodies the principles of His kingdom." (COL 305.1). "These two great principles embrace the first four commandments, showing the duty of man to God, and the last six, showing the duty of man to his fellowman." (1BC 1104.3).
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: Counteracts the idea that the law is burdensome or irrelevant; establishes it as beautiful and desirable because it reflects God Himself.

-   **B. Love as the Underlying Principle:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: Every commandment, rightly understood, flows from the principle of selfless love. Obedience isn't just rule-following, but heart-alignment with God's love.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Romans 13:10 ("Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law."); 1 John 4:8, 16 ("God is love").
    -   EGW Insight: "Both these commandments [love God, love neighbor] are an expression of the principle of love. The first cannot be kept and the second broken, nor can the second be kept while the first is broken." (DA 607.3).
    -   Application/Obstacles to Depth: Addresses superficial understanding; challenges us to see the loving *motive* behind each command.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* A perfect blueprint (the Law) reveals the mind and intention (character) of the Master Architect (God). We admire the blueprint because we admire the Architect.
-   *Metaphor:* The Law is like the DNA of God's Kingdom – it contains the code of His character, which is love.

***Whiteboard Visuals:***
-   *Keyword:* CHARACTER = LAW = LOVE
-   *Diagram:* Two Tablets: 1-4 (Love GOD <-> Heart) | 5-10 (Love MAN <-> Hands)
-   *Verse:* Matt 22:37-40 / Rom 13:10
-   *Quote Snippet:* "...transcript of His character." (COL 305)

***Discussion Questions:*** (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* "In your own words, how did Jesus summarize the entire Law?"
-   *(Reflection):* "Why is it significant that the Law is described as a 'transcript of God's character' rather than just a list of rules?"
-   *(Application):* "How does viewing the Law as an expression of God's love change your motivation for obedience?"

### III. Law, Grace, and the Transformed Heart ({Estimated Time} 10-12 mins)
-   **A. The Law's Role After the Cross: Revealing Sin & Need:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: The Law remains holy, just, and good. Its primary role for the sinner (and the believer recognizing remaining sinfulness) is to reveal sin and our desperate need for Christ's grace and righteousness. It cannot save, but it diagnoses.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Romans 7:7, 12 ("...I would not have known sin except through the law... the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good."); Romans 3:20 ("...by the law is the knowledge of sin."); Galatians 3:24 (Law as schoolmaster/tutor to bring us to Christ).
    -   EGW Insight: "As the sinner looks into the great moral looking glass, he sees his defects of character... But he knows that the law cannot in any way remove the guilt or pardon the transgressor. He must go farther than this. The law is but the schoolmaster to bring him to Christ." (1SM 213.3-4).
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: Addresses the error that grace abolishes the law; clarifies the law's diagnostic function.

-   **B. Grace Empowers Loving Obedience:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: True salvation through grace doesn't lead to lawlessness, but to a heart transformation where God writes His law within us. Faith in Christ enables, empowers, and motivates loving obedience.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Hebrews 8:10 ("I will put My laws in their mind and write them on their hearts..."); Ezekiel 36:26-27 (Promise of a new heart and Spirit causing obedience); John 14:15 ("If you love Me, keep My commandments.").
    -   EGW Insight: "It is the grace of Christ alone, through faith, that can make us holy... Instead of releasing man from obedience, it is faith, and faith only, that makes us partakers of the grace of Christ, which enables us to render obedience." (SC 60.2, 60.4).
    -   Application/Character Trait Focus: Cultivates dependence on Christ, humility, and a desire for genuine heart-holiness, not just outward conformity.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* The Law is like an X-ray showing the broken bone (sin). It reveals the problem perfectly but cannot fix it. The Doctor (Christ) and His treatment (grace) bring healing, which results in the bone being set correctly (obedience).
-   *Metaphor:* Trying to obey in our own strength is like trying to build a house with faulty materials on shifting sand. Grace provides a solid foundation (Christ's righteousness) and the right materials (the Holy Spirit's power) to build a character that reflects the blueprint (Law).

-   *Verse:* Rom 7:12 / Heb 8:10 / John 14:15
-   *Quote Snippet:* "...faith... enables us to render obedience." (SC 60)

***Discussion Questions:*** (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Recall):* "According to Romans 7, what is one key purpose of the Law?"
-   *(Reflection):* "How can we avoid the two errors mentioned in the EGW notes: trying to be saved by works (legalism) versus thinking faith cancels obedience (cheap grace)?" (SC 59-60)
-   *(Application):* "When you feel struggle in obeying God, how can remembering Hebrews 8:10 (God writing the law on the heart) give you hope and direction?"

### IV. Love in Action: Fulfillment and End-Time Readiness ({Estimated Time} 8-10 mins)
-   **A. Love Beyond Prohibition: Active Righteousness:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Fulfilling the law through love isn't just about *not* doing wrong (sins of commission), but actively doing good, seeking justice, showing mercy, and reflecting Christ's selfless service (sins of omission avoided).
    -   Biblical Foundation: Matthew 23:23 (Weightier matters: justice, mercy, faith); Isaiah 58:6-10 (True fasting/Sabbath-keeping involves active compassion); James 2:8, 14-17 (Faith without works is dead; fulfilling the royal law means practical care).
    -   EGW Insight: "The sin which is indulged to the greatest extent... is selfishness. There can be no returning to the Lord except by self-denial... We should do this in the home circle, in the church, among those with whom we associate... Right in the common walks of life is where self is to be denied..." (T2 132.2).
    -   Application/Character Trait Focus: Develops selflessness, compassion, practical service, and a focus on others' needs as the natural outflow of love for God.

-   **B. Fitted for Heaven: Love as the Evidence of Readiness:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: The visible manifestation of Christ-like love in our lives, especially towards others (even the 'unlovable' world), is the evidence that His mission is accomplished in us and we are being fitted for heaven. This is the character preparation for His return.
    -   Biblical Foundation: John 13:34-35 ("By this all will know... if you have love for one another"); Matthew 25:31-46 (Judgment based on practical acts of love); 1 Peter 4:8 ("Above all things have fervent love...").
    -   EGW Insight: "When His parting words are fulfilled, ‘Love one another, as I have loved you’ (John 15:12); when we love the world as He has loved it, then for us His mission is accomplished. We are fitted for heaven; for we have heaven in our hearts." (DA 641.2).
    -   Application/End-Time Relevance: Connects our daily interactions and service directly to our preparation for Christ's imminent return and the final judgment.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Hypothetical Example:* Imagine two people who both avoid stealing. One does it out of fear of punishment. The other does it because they genuinely care about their neighbor's well-being and property, and actively look for ways to help them prosper. The second person demonstrates love fulfilling the law.
-   *Analogy:* Training for the final exam (Christ's return) isn't just about avoiding wrong answers (sin), but mastering the subject (love) so well that applying it becomes second nature in every situation.

-   *Diagram:* Heart (Love) -> Hands/Feet (Action: Justice, Mercy, Service) -> Crown (Readiness)
-   *Verse:* James 2:8 / John 13:35 / Matt 25:40
-   *Quote Snippet:* "...fitted for heaven; for we have heaven in our hearts." (DA 641)

***Discussion Questions:*** (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* "According to James 2, what is the 'royal law'?"
-   *(Reflection):* "Why is simply *not* breaking commandments insufficient for fulfilling the law through love?" (Think about Isaiah 58 or Matthew 25).
-   *(Application):* "Reflecting on the DA 641 quote, what is one practical way we can 'love the world as He has loved it' this week, showing we are being 'fitted for heaven'?"

### V. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary: Reiterate core deep takeaways (simply): God's Law is His loving character. It reveals our need for grace. Grace transforms the heart, writing the Law within, enabling loving obedience. This active, selfless love is the fulfillment of the Law and the necessary preparation for eternity.
-   Character Focus Recap: Emphasize the high calling to reflect Christ's perfect love (Matt 5:48) and the glorious possibility of achieving this *through Him*.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Key Character Trait: CHRISTLIKE LOVE)*
-   Call to Action/Decision: Challenge class members to move beyond passive avoidance of sin to active, Spirit-empowered love. "Will you ask God this week to reveal one area where He wants you to practice *active* love, fulfilling His law from a transformed heart?"
    -   *(Whiteboard: Call to Action Keyword: CHOOSE ACTIVE LOVE)*
    -   *(Optional Final Question):* "What specific step, empowered by grace, will you take to better reflect God's loving character this week?" (Rhetorical lead-in to prayer)
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: End with assurance and urgency. "Christ's love, implanted by His Spirit, is the power that perfects character and prepares a people to stand. Let us behold Him, seek His grace, and allow His love to flow through us. He is coming soon!" (cf. SC 28.3; Rev 22:12).
