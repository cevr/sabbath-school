**(Time Allocation Guide: Total 45 Minutes)**

**I. Introduction: The Unseen Reality (6 minutes)**
    *   Welcome and opening prayer.
    *   Introduce the concept: We live amidst an invisible, cosmic conflict – a battle between Christ and Satan over God's character, His law, and His sovereignty.
    *   This isn't just abstract theology; it has profound implications for understanding suffering, temptation, and world events.
    *   Introduce the idea of "Rules of Engagement" – parameters within which this conflict unfolds. God, in His wisdom and love, operates according to principles, even allowing temporary space for evil to reveal its true nature.
    *   **Memory Text:** 1 John 3:8 (NKJV): "He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.” – Christ's mission is central to resolving this conflict.

**II. Glimpses Behind the Veil: Angels, Dragons, and Kings (11 minutes)**
    *   **Sunday - An Angel Delayed:**
        *   **Central Point:** Heavenly beings are actively involved in the affairs of earth, and face opposition from demonic forces who influence human rulers. God works within certain self-imposed limits based on His character of love and respect for free will.
        *   **Bible Study:** Daniel 10:1-14 (esp. v. 12-13).
            *   Daniel prays earnestly.
            *   An angel (Gabriel) is dispatched immediately (v. 12).
            *   He is "withstood" for 21 days by the "prince of the kingdom of Persia" (a satanic agent influencing the earthly king).
            *   Michael (Christ) comes to help.
            *   This reveals a real struggle, not instant divine overpowering. God allows the conflict to play out to demonstrate principles.
        *   **EGW:** "For three weeks Gabriel wrestled with the powers of darkness, seeking to counteract the influences at work on the mind of Cyrus.... All that heaven could do in behalf of the people of God was done. The victory was finally gained; the forces of the enemy were held in check all the days of Cyrus, and all the days of his son Cambyses." (PK 572.1). "As a people we do not understand as we should the great conflict going on between invisible agencies, the controversy between loyal and disloyal angels. Evil angels are constantly at work, planning their line of attack, controlling as commanders, kings, and rulers, the disloyal human forces." (4BC 1173.4).
    *   **Monday - The Dragon of Revelation:** [*]
        *   **Central Point:** Revelation portrays Satan (the Dragon) as having significant, though temporary and limited, influence over earthly powers that oppose God and persecute His people.
        *   **Bible Study:** Revelation 12:7-9, 12; Revelation 13:1-8.
            *   Satan cast down, knows his time is short (Rev 12:12).
            *   Gives power, throne, authority to the sea beast (earthly religio-political power) (Rev 13:2).
            *   This beast wages war on saints, given authority for a limited time (42 months) (Rev 13:5, 7).
            *   Satan works through earthly agencies, but God sets prophetic time limits.
        *   **EGW:** "Under the symbols of a great red dragon, a leopardlike beast, and a beast with lamblike horns, the earthly governments which would especially engage in trampling upon God's law and persecuting His people, were presented to John. The war is carried on till the close of time." (7BC 972.7).

**III. Case Studies: Job and Jesus (11 minutes)**
    *   **Tuesday - The Case of Job:**
        *   **Central Point:** The book of Job provides a unique window into the heavenly aspect of the controversy, showing Satan accusing God and His followers, and God allowing trials within strict limits to vindicate His own character and Job's integrity.
        *   **Bible Study:** Job 1:1-12; Job 2:1-7.
            *   Heavenly council scene (Job 1:6; 2:1).
            *   God initiates discussion about Job's faithfulness (Job 1:8).
            *   Satan accuses Job of serving God only for blessings (Job 1:9-11). Slanders God's character (implying God bribes loyalty) and Job's.
            *   God permits Satan to test Job, but sets clear limits: first property/family (Job 1:12), then health, but spare his life (Job 2:6). These are "rules of engagement."
            *   Job's faithfulness under trial refutes Satan's claims.
        *   **EGW:** "God had given a lesson designed to prevent this [misunderstanding suffering]. The history of Job had shown that suffering is inflicted by Satan, and is overruled by God for purposes of mercy." (DA 471.2). "A guardian angel is appointed to every follower of Christ. These heavenly watchers shield the righteous from the power of the wicked one. This Satan himself recognized when he said: ‘Doth Job fear God for nought? Hast not Thou made an hedge about him...?’ Job 1:9, 10." (GC 512.4).
    *   **Wednesday - The (Temporary) Ruler of This World:** [*]
        *   **Central Point:** Jesus acknowledged Satan as the temporary usurping "ruler of this world," whose power operates within limits defined by God's overarching plan and Christ's mission to defeat him.
        *   **Bible Study:** John 12:31; John 14:30; John 16:11; 2 Corinthians 4:4; Luke 4:6; 1 John 3:8.
            *   Jesus calls Satan "the ruler of this world" (John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11).
            *   Satan claims authority was given to him (Luke 4:6) – a claim based on Adam's fall.
            *   Paul calls him "the god of this age" (2 Cor 4:4).
            *   BUT Christ came to "destroy the works of the devil" (1 John 3:8) and cast him out (John 12:31). His rule is temporary and illegitimate.
        *   **EGW:** "After tempting man to sin, Satan claimed the earth as his, and styled himself the prince of this world.... Christ had come to disprove Satan's claim. As the Son of man, Christ would stand loyal to God. Thus it would be shown that Satan had not gained complete control of the human race, and that his claim to the world was false." (DA 114.2). "[Jesus said] ‘The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in Me.’ ... With prophetic eye Christ traced the scenes to take place in His last great conflict. He knew that when He should exclaim, ‘It is finished,’ all heaven would triumph.... He knew that the knell of Satan's empire would then be sounded..." (DA 679.1).

**IV. Our Engagement: Faith, Prayer, and Trust (10 minutes)**
    *   **Thursday - Limits and Rules:**
        *   **Central Point:** God's actions in the world, while sovereign, are often related to human factors like faith and prayer, operating within the "rules" He has established based on His character of love and justice. Character development requires cooperation with God.
        *   **Bible Study:** Mark 6:5; Mark 9:29; Romans 8:18; Revelation 21:3-4.
            *   Jesus "could do no mighty work there [Nazareth], except... He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them" (Mark 6:5) - Unbelief limited the manifestation of His power, not the power itself.
            *   Certain demonic power requires prayer and fasting (Mark 9:29) – Human spiritual engagement matters.
            *   These aren't arbitrary rules, but reflect divine principles. God doesn't force belief or blessing.
            *   **The Need for Trust:** We don't know all the rules or reasons. We see suffering (Rom 8:18). But we trust God's ultimate goodness and plan.
            *   **The Ultimate Outcome:** God *will* end evil. He *will* dwell with us. No more tears, death, sorrow, pain (Rev 21:3-4). This is the certain hope that anchors us.
        *   **EGW:** "In the divine arrangement God does nothing without the cooperation of man.... Jesus declared that in a certain place He could not do many mighty works among the people because of their unbelief.... The potter cannot mold and fashion unto honor that which has never been placed in his hands." (TMK 55.2). "The only way for such poor souls [captivated by Satan] to overcome Satan, is to discern between pure Bible truth and fables.... They should entreat those who have had a religious experience, and who have faith in the promises of God, to plead with the mighty Deliverer in their behalf.... if the saints of God with deep humility fast and pray, their prayers will prevail." (1T 343.2). "For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us” (Romans 8:18)." (TMK 280.6).

**V. Conclusion: Living Faithfully Within the Conflict (7 minutes)**
    *   **Recap:** We've seen glimpses of the cosmic conflict – a real battle with real stakes, fought according to divine principles ("rules of engagement"). Satan has temporary, limited power, evidenced in Daniel, Job, and Revelation.
    *   **God's Character:** God's methods are rooted in love, truth, and freedom, not coercion. He allows evil to reveal itself fully, ultimately vindicating His own just and loving character.
    *   **Our Role:** We are not mere spectators. Our faith, prayer, and choices matter (Mark 6:5, 9:29). We are called to vigilance, reliance on Christ, and faithfulness like Job's. Character development – becoming like Jesus – is our preparation and our witness in this conflict.
    *   **The Hope:** Satan is the "ruler of *this* world," but his time is short (Rev 12:12). Christ, through His life, death, and resurrection, has secured the ultimate victory (1 John 3:8; John 12:31). The promise of Revelation 21:3-4 is sure.
    *   **Call to Action:** Let us live with awareness of this conflict, not in fear, but in faith. Let us "watch and pray" (Matt 26:41), trusting wholly in our mighty Conqueror, Christ Jesus. Let us cooperate with Him in developing characters fit for His eternal kingdom, knowing that the final triumph of good is assured. Understand that "Fallen man is Satan's lawful captive. The mission of Christ was to rescue him from the power of his great adversary... God alone can limit the power of Satan." (1T 341.1). Rely fully on Christ.
    *   Closing prayer, asking for wisdom, strength, and unwavering faith amidst the conflict.
