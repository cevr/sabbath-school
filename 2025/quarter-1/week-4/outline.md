**(Time Allocation Guide: Total 45 Minutes)**

---

**I. Introduction (6 minutes)**

*   **Opening Hook:** We often think of emotions as weak or irrational, something to be controlled or suppressed. Ancient philosophers even prized unemotional reason. But what does the Bible reveal about God? Is He merely a distant, logical force?
*   **This Week's Study:** We explore the profound truth that God Himself experiences deep emotions – specifically, powerful compassion and passionate love for His people. His emotions, unlike ours, are perfect, holy, and rational.
*   **Memory Text:** Isaiah 49:15 (NKJV) - *"Can a woman forget her nursing child, And not have compassion on the son of her womb? Surely they may forget, Yet I will not forget you."*
    *   This sets the stage: God's love and commitment exceed even the most powerful human bonds.
*   **Lesson Goal:** To understand the depth and nature of God's compassionate and passionate love, and how this understanding should shape our character and our relationship with Him and others, preparing us for eternity.
    *   "Christ's love is deep and earnest, flowing like an irrepressible stream to all who will accept it. There is no selfishness in His love." (SD 101.2)

**II. More Than a Mother's Love (Sunday - 7 minutes)**

*   **Central Point:** God's compassion (*raham*) is portrayed using the most profound human examples (father's pity, mother's love) but is infinitely deeper and more reliable.
*   **Biblical Foundation:**
    *   **Psalm 103:13:** "As a father pities his children, So the LORD pities those who fear Him." (Paternal tenderness)
    *   **Isaiah 49:15:** (Memory Text) God contrasts the potential failure of a mother's compassion (*raham*) with His own unfailing compassion and remembrance. The root *raham* connects to "womb," suggesting a deep, nurturing, life-giving love.
    *   **Jeremiah 31:20:** "Is Ephraim My dear son? Is he a pleasant child? For though I spoke against him, I surely remember him still. Therefore My heart yearns for him; I will surely have mercy (*raham*) on him, says the LORD." (God's inner being is deeply moved - "innards roar" - for His wayward child).
*   **Ellen G. White Insight:**
    *   "Here is seen love stronger than death... And yet God says that the mother will sooner forget her child than that He will forget a soul that trusts in Him." (Letter 12, 1873)
    *   "But even this parable [Prodigal Son], tender and touching as it is, comes short of expressing the infinite compassion of the heavenly Father... the Father's heart is yearning over him..." (SC 54.1)
*   **Character Application:** Recognizing God's unwavering, "womb-like" compassion provides ultimate security. Even if human love has failed us, His love never does (Lam 3:22). This assurance builds trust and heals wounds, allowing His loving character to be formed in us. How does this truth counter feelings of unworthiness or abandonment?

**III. Gut-Wrenching Love (Monday - 7 minutes)**

*   **Central Point:** God's love is not indifferent; He is deeply grieved by our unfaithfulness, experiencing profound emotional pain, yet His compassion endures.
*   **Biblical Foundation:**
    *   **Hosea 1:2:** God commands Hosea to embody His own experience by marrying an unfaithful woman, demonstrating the pain of betrayal God feels.
    *   **Hosea 11:1-4:** Recounts God's tender, parental care for Israel ("taught Ephraim to walk, Taking them by their arms... healed them... drew them with gentle cords, With bands of love").
    *   **Hosea 11:8-9:** "How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel?... My heart churns within Me; My sympathy [*nichum* - compassion, related to *raham*] is stirred [*kamar* - kindled, grow warm]." God's deep emotional turmoil (*kamar* - also used in 1 Kings 3:26 for the true mother's reaction) restrains His judgment. His love prevails over His righteous anger.
*   **Ellen G. White Insight:**
    *   "Tenderly had the Lord dealt with Israel... 'In all their affliction He was afflicted, and the angel of His presence saved them: in His love and in His pity He redeemed them; and He bare them, and carried them all the days of old.'" (PK 311.4, quoting Isa 63:9).
    *   "Not a sigh is breathed, not a pain felt, not a grief pierces the soul, but the throb vibrates to the Father's heart." (DA 356.2)
*   **Character Application:** Understanding God's grief over sin should break our hearts and lead to genuine repentance. It's not just breaking rules; it's wounding the One who loves us with gut-wrenching tenderness. This motivates faithfulness born of love, not just duty, reflecting His steadfast character.

**IV. The Compassion of Jesus (Tuesday - 7 minutes) [*]**

*   **Central Point:** Jesus, the perfect image of the Father, consistently demonstrated divine compassion (*splanchnizomai* - moved in one's bowels/inner parts) in response to human suffering, translating feeling into action.
*   **Biblical Foundation:**
    *   **Matthew 9:36:** Moved with compassion for the leaderless, distressed crowds ("like sheep having no shepherd").
    *   **Matthew 14:14:** Moved with compassion, He healed the sick multitude.
    *   **Mark 1:41:** Moved with compassion, Jesus touched and healed the leper.
    *   **Luke 7:13:** Moved with compassion for the grieving widow of Nain, He raised her son.
    *   **Matthew 23:37:** Jesus' lament over Jerusalem ("How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks...") echoes God's protective, parental compassion (cf. Deut 32:11).
*   **Ellen G. White Insight:**
    *   "When Christ saw the multitudes... 'He was moved with compassion on them'... To Him were presented the needs and woes of humanity..." (6T 254.1).
    *   "Greater than the love of a mother for her child is Christ's love for His redeemed... When we cry to Him for help, His hand is stretched out to save." (MH 72.2).
*   **Character Application:** Jesus is our perfect example. His compassion wasn't passive pity; it was active love meeting tangible needs. We are called to reflect His character by not just feeling for others, but by acting compassionately, showing God's love in practical ways. How can we move from sympathy to service?

**V. A Jealous God? (Wednesday - 5 minutes) [*]**

*   **Central Point:** God's "jealousy" (*qana'*) is not sinful human envy, but a righteous, passionate zeal arising from His deep love, desiring exclusive devotion for our ultimate good and protection.
*   **Biblical Foundation:**
    *   **Deuteronomy 4:24:** "For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous [*qana'*] God." This follows warnings against idolatry.
    *   **Deuteronomy 4:31:** Yet, He is also "a merciful [*rachum*] God." His jealousy and compassion coexist, both rooted in love.
    *   **2 Corinthians 11:2:** Paul expresses "godly jealousy" (*zelos*) for the Corinthians, wanting to present them as a pure bride to Christ. This mirrors God's desire.
    *   **Psalm 78:58:** Israel "provoked Him to jealousy with their carved images." Idolatry wounds His loving heart.
    *   **Contrast 1 Corinthians 13:4:** *Agape* love "does not envy" (human *zeloo*). Divine jealousy is different – protective, not possessive or covetous.
*   **Ellen G. White Insight:**
    *   "God is a being of infinite love and compassion, but He also declares Himself to be a 'consuming fire, even a jealous God.'" (3BC 1166.6). His jealousy stems from His hatred of sin that destroys His beloved.
    *   Marriage symbolism: "The husband is to cherish his wife as Christ cherishes the church." (7T 46.3). This implies exclusive, protective love.
*   **Character Application:** Understanding God's holy jealousy helps us see the gravity of divided loyalties (idolatry, worldliness). It calls us to wholehearted devotion, appreciating His passionate desire for an exclusive relationship that is ultimately for our protection and blessing. This fosters purity of heart.

**VI. Reflecting God's Compassionate Love (Thursday - 6 minutes)**

*   **Central Point:** We cannot manufacture God's kind of love (*agape*); it is a fruit of the Holy Spirit, poured into our hearts, enabling us to reflect His compassionate and passionate character.
*   **Biblical Foundation:**
    *   **1 Corinthians 13:4-8:** Describes the characteristics of divine love – patient, kind, not envious, not proud, not rude, not self-seeking, etc. This is the love God *is* and the love He wants to reproduce in us.
    *   **Romans 5:5:** "...the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us." This is the source of our ability to love like God.
    *   **1 Thessalonians 3:12-13:** Paul prays for believers to "increase and abound in love to one another and to all... so that He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness..." Love and holiness are linked.
*   **Ellen G. White Insight:**
    *   "Love is not simply an impulse... it is a living principle, a permanent power. The soul is fed by the streams of pure love that flow from the heart of Christ..." (SD 101.2).
    *   "As you receive the Spirit of Christ—the Spirit of unselfish love and labor for others—you will grow and bring forth fruit... Your faith will increase, your convictions deepen, your love be made perfect." (COL 67.3).
*   **Character Application:** Reflecting God's love requires a death to self (COL 67.3). We must consciously yield to the Holy Spirit, asking Him to fill us with *agape*. Practical steps: Pray daily for the Spirit's infilling, practice intentional acts of kindness, confess selfishness, meditate on Christ's love. This is how His image is restored in us.

**VII. Conclusion (7 minutes)**

*   **Summary:** We've seen that our God is not distant or unfeeling. He loves with a compassion deeper than a mother's, feels gut-wrenching pain over our sin, demonstrated perfect empathy in Jesus, possesses a righteous jealousy for our exclusive love, and offers His own Spirit to reproduce this perfect love in us.
*   **Character Imperative:** Understanding God's passionate and compassionate heart is fundamental to our own character development. He yearns to restore His image – His character of perfect love – in us. This is the essence of sanctification and readiness for His kingdom.
*   **Final Appeal:** How does knowing the depth of God's emotional investment change your perspective on sin? On your relationship with Him? On how you view and treat others? Let us earnestly seek the baptism of the Holy Spirit daily, that we might die to self and truly reflect the passionate, compassionate love of our soon-coming King.
*   **Closing Thought:** "All who have a sense of their deep soul poverty... may find righteousness and strength by looking unto Jesus... He presents us to the Father clothed in the white raiment of His own character... Look not upon this wayward child, but look on Me." (MB 8.3, 9.1). Our hope lies not in our fluctuating emotions or imperfect love, but in His perfect character covering us and His Spirit transforming us.
*   **Prayer:** Pray for a deeper revelation of God's love and for the infilling of the Holy Spirit to enable the class to reflect that love more fully.
