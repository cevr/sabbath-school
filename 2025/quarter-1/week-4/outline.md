**I. Introduction (5-7 mins)**
    *   Hook: "We often speak of love, but do we truly grasp the *depth* and *nature* of God's love? It's unlike anything human – deeper than a mother's, fiercer than a warrior's protection, yet infinitely tender."
    *   Theme Introduction: Today, we explore the profound theme: The Unfathomable Depths of God's Covenant Love and Its Transforming Power. Understanding this isn't just theology; it's vital for our spiritual life.
        *   *(Whiteboard: Write Main Theme Title: God's Deep Covenant Love & Our Transformation)*
    *   Connection to Character/Eternity: Grasping God's love—His compassion *and* His righteous zeal—is essential for developing the Christ-like character needed to stand in the last days and reflect His glory. It fuels our sanctification. "Our heavenly Father... wants to restore His moral image in man." (SC 55).
    *   Roadmap: We'll examine (1) The depth of God's Compassion, (2) The meaning of His Righteous Passion or "Jealousy," and (3) How this divine love, seen in Christ, empowers us to love and live ready for His return.

**II. The Depths of Divine Compassion (10-12 mins)**
    *   **A. More Than a Mother's Love (Raham):**
        *   Core Teaching Point: The Bible uses the Hebrew word *raham* (often translated compassion or mercy) which is linked to the word for "womb." It signifies a deep, visceral, nurturing, life-giving love far exceeding even the strongest human bond.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Isaiah 49:15 - "Can a woman forget her nursing child... Yet I will not forget you." Jeremiah 31:20 (NKJV) - God calls Ephraim "a dear son... My heart yearns for him; I will surely have mercy (*raham*) on him." Hosea 11:1-4, 8 - God describes His tender care like a parent teaching a child to walk, healing them, feeding them, His heart churning within Him.
        *   EGW Insight: "While the sinner is yet far from the Father's house... the Father's heart is yearning over him; and every longing awakened in the soul to return to God is but the tender pleading of His Spirit, wooing, entreating, drawing the wanderer to his Father's heart of love." (SC 54). "God's love is speaking to you." (Letter 12, 1873, cited HP 269).
        *   Application/Problem Tackled: We feel forgotten, unworthy, or distant. God's *raham* assures us His core nature is unwavering, tender compassion, deeper than we can imagine.

    *   ***Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1):***
        *   *Analogy:* Think of the fiercest, most tender love you know – perhaps a mother for her newborn. God says His love is *even more* reliable, more deeply rooted in His very being (Isa 49:15). He *cannot* forget us. (Reference EGW story of mother in snow, HP 269).
        *   *Metaphor:* God's compassion isn't just a feeling; it's like the very source of life, the "womb" from which His care flows constantly.

    *   ***Whiteboard Visuals:***
        *   *Keyword:* RAHAM = "Womb-Love"
        *   *Diagram:* Heart -> Outstretched Arms (Yearning)
        *   *Verse:* Isa 49:15 - "I will NOT forget you."
        *   *Quote Snippet:* "...Father's heart is yearning..." (SC 54)

    *   ***Discussion Questions (Allow brief time):***
        *   *(Simple/Observation):* In Isaiah 49:15, what human love does God compare His love to, and what does He say is the difference?
        *   *(Reflection):* Why might the idea of God having this deep, "womb-like" compassion (raham) be particularly comforting or perhaps even challenging for some people?
        *   *(Application):* How does knowing God feels this deep yearning and compassion for you personally change how you approach Him in prayer, especially when you feel you've failed?

**III. The Righteous Passion of a Jealous God (10-12 mins)** [*]
    *   **A. Zealous Covenant Love (Qana'):**
        *   Core Teaching Point: God is called "jealous" (*qana'* in Hebrew), not in the petty, envious human sense (condemned in 1 Cor 13:4), but signifying a righteous, zealous, passionate commitment to His covenant relationship with us, desiring our exclusive loyalty for our own protection and blessing.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Deut 4:24 - "For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous (*qana'*) God." Exodus 34:14 - "you shall worship no other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God." This is about His holiness and protective love for His people, guarding them from destructive idols/influences.
        *   EGW Insight: "God is a being of infinite love and compassion, but He also declares Himself to be a 'consuming fire, even a jealous God.'" (3BC 1166). "We can comprehend no more of His dealings... than He sees fit to reveal... we must trust the hand that is omnipotent, the heart that is full of love." (LHU 361). His jealousy stems from His love and desire for our ultimate good.

    *   **B. Protecting the Relationship:** [*]
        *   Core Teaching Point: God's "jealousy" is His intense desire to protect us from anything that would harm us or draw us away from Him, the source of life and true joy. It's the passion of a loving Bridegroom for His bride.
        *   Biblical Foundation: 2 Cor 11:2 - Paul speaks of a "godly jealousy," wanting to present the church as a pure bride to Christ. Hosea 1-3 - Depicts God as the faithful husband yearning for His unfaithful wife (Israel) to return.
        *   Application/Obstacles to Depth: We are tempted to divide our affections, seeking fulfillment in worldly things. Understanding God's zealous love helps us see this not just as breaking rules, but as grieving the heart of the One who loves us most and wants our best.

    *   ***Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2):***
        *   *Analogy:* Imagine a devoted husband who sees someone trying to harm his wife or lead her astray. His "jealousy" isn't petty possessiveness; it's a fierce, protective love rising up to defend her and preserve their sacred bond. God's jealousy is like that, but infinitely more pure and righteous.
        *   *Metaphor:* God's zealous love is like a purifying fire (Deut 4:24) – it consumes the dross (sin, idols) that threatens to destroy us, preserving the pure gold of our relationship with Him.

    *   ***Whiteboard Visuals:***
        *   *Keyword:* QANA' = Zealous / Protective Love
        *   *Diagram:* Covenant Rings (Exclusive Bond) + Shield (Protection)
        *   *Verse:* Deut 4:24 / 2 Cor 11:2
        *   *Contrast:* Godly Jealousy (Protective Love) ≠ Human Jealousy (Envy/Selfishness)

    *   ***Discussion Questions (Allow brief time):***
        *   *(Simple/Recall):* What is the key difference between God's "jealousy" (qana') and the negative human jealousy warned against in 1 Corinthians 13?
        *   *(Reflection):* How does viewing God's "jealousy" as protective covenant love, rather than divine anger, change your perspective on His commandments and calls for exclusive loyalty?
        *   *(Application):* What "idols" or divided affections in our modern lives might provoke God's righteous, protective jealousy because they harm our relationship with Him?

**IV. Reflecting Divine Love: The Call to Transformation (10-11 mins)**
    *   **A. Love Embodied and Empowered:**
        *   Core Teaching Point: Jesus perfectly embodied God's compassionate and passionate love. He was moved by human need (Matt 9:36) and lamented over rejection (Matt 23:37). This same divine love (agape) described in 1 Cor 13 is poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit (Rom 5:5), enabling us to reflect His character.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Matt 9:36; Matt 14:14; Mark 6:34 (Jesus moved with compassion). 1 Cor 13:4-8 (Characteristics of divine love). Rom 5:5 (Love poured out by Spirit). 1 Thess 3:12-13 (Prayer to abound in love, established blameless).
        *   EGW Insight: "Greater than the love of a mother for her child is Christ's love for His redeemed." (MH 72). "Love is... a living principle, a permanent power... Under the education and discipline of the Holy Spirit, the children of God love one another..." (SDG 101). "As you receive the Spirit of Christ—the Spirit of unselfish love and labor for others—you will grow and bring forth fruit." (COL 67-68).
        *   Application/Character Trait Focus: This divine love isn't just a feeling; it's active, patient, kind, humble, selfless, enduring. It requires dying to self and relying wholly on the Spirit's power.

    *   ***Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1):***
        *   *Analogy:* We are like mirrors designed to reflect the sun (God's love). By ourselves, we are dull. But when the Son shines on us and the Spirit cleans the mirror (sanctification), we can reflect His warmth and light to others.
        *   *Hypothetical Example:* Imagine trying to lift an impossibly heavy weight (living 1 Cor 13) in your own strength versus using a powerful hydraulic lift (the Holy Spirit). We need His power.

    *   ***Whiteboard Visuals:***
        *   *Keyword:* AGAPE / REFLECTION
        *   *Diagram:* Cross -> Heart -> Outward Arrows (Love Flowing)
        *   *Verse:* 1 Cor 13:4-8 / Rom 5:5
        *   *Action:* Die to Self -> Live by Spirit

    *   ***Discussion Questions (Allow brief time):***
        *   *(Simple/Observation):* According to Romans 5:5, how do we receive the ability to love like God loves?
        *   *(Reflection):* Why is it impossible to truly live out the love described in 1 Corinthians 13 without the Holy Spirit's power and a daily death to self?
        *   *(Application):* Thinking about the characteristics in 1 Corinthians 13 (patient, kind, not envious, etc.), which one do you feel the Holy Spirit prompting you to cultivate more intentionally this week?

**V. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)**
    *   Summary: We've glimpsed the incredible depth of God's love – His tender, unwavering compassion (*raham*) and His zealous, protective covenant passion (*qana'*). This isn't a distant theological concept; it's the very heart of our God.
    *   Character Focus Recap: This profound love is the standard and the power source for our transformation. He calls us to reflect His character, to become "blameless in holiness" (1 Thess 3:13), ready for His appearing.
        *   *(Whiteboard: Key Character Trait: FAITHFUL LOVE)*
    *   Call to Action/Decision: Will we respond to this amazing love? Will we stop trusting our own efforts and fully surrender to the Holy Spirit's work, allowing Him to fill us with this divine love and make us like Jesus? Let's ask Him daily to deepen our understanding and transform our hearts.
        *   *(Whiteboard: Call to Action Keyword: SURRENDER / RECEIVE / REFLECT)*
        *   *(Optional Final Question):* "What aspect of God's deep love discussed today most encourages or challenges you personally?" (Rhetorical, leading into final thought)
    *   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: "As you draw near to Him with confession and repentance, He will draw near to you with mercy and forgiveness." (SC 55). His love is seeking you, yearning for you. Let us respond fully, preparing our characters for His soon return.
        *   *(Whiteboard: Final Verse Ref or Hope phrase: Rev 22:12 / "He Is Faithful!")*
