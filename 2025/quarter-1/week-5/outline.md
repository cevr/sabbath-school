### Introduction (Approx. 6 minutes)

*   **Opening Question**: How do we reconcile the concept of a loving God with the biblical descriptions of His wrath? Many find this disturbing, even contradictory. Is God's wrath simply divine anger, or something more profound?
*   **Core Concept**: This week, we explore the challenging but vital truth that God's wrath arises *precisely because* He is love. It is His righteous, loving response against evil and injustice that harms His creation and distorts His character. It's not petty human anger, but holy indignation rooted in perfect goodness.
    *   "The God who is love does become angry at evil—but precisely because He is love." (Lesson Introduction)
    *   "Christ's indignation was directed against the hypocrisy, the gross sins, by which men were destroying their own souls... He had a holy wrath against the prince of darkness; but He manifested no irritated temper." (LHU 337.1)
*   **Memory Text**: Psalm 78:38 (NKJV) - "But He, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and did not destroy them. Yes, many a time He turned His anger away, and did not stir up all His wrath.”
    *   Note the balance: Compassion leads Him to forgive and turn anger away *repeatedly*. His wrath exists, but His nature leans towards mercy.
*   **Lesson Aim**: To understand divine wrath not as arbitrary fury, but as an integral part of God's loving and just character, motivating us to hate sin, embrace His mercy, and reflect His compassion in our own lives, ultimately restoring His image in us.

### Sunday: Grieved by Evil (Approx. 6 minutes)

*   **Central Point**: God's passion against sin stems from His love for His creation and His grief over the harm evil inflicts.
*   **Biblical Foundation**:
    *   **Psalm 78**: Recounts Israel's "cycle of rebellion."
        *   (vv. 9-11, 17-22, 32, 40-41, 56-58) Rebellion, forgetting God's works, testing God, provoking Him.
        *   (vv. 21-22, 31, 59-64) God's anger/wrath expressed often through withdrawal or allowing consequences (oppression).
        *   (vv. 33-37) People seek God only when afflicted, but insincerely.
        *   (vv. 38-39) **Key**: Despite this cycle, God is "full of compassion," forgives, restrains His wrath, remembers their weakness. This isn't weakness, but divine strength and love.
    *   **Nehemiah 9:7-33**: Similar pattern of God's faithfulness vs. Israel's repeated unfaithfulness, yet God's great mercies persist.
*   **Ellen G. White Insights**:
    *   "Yet they did not turn to God with a sincere purpose... But He, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned He His anger away... For He remembered that they were but flesh..." (PP 410.3) - Echoes Psalm 78.
    *   "God is constantly appealing to the human heart, bidding it recognize His love and mercy, and accept His righteousness in the place of the principles of evil." (TDWG 278.4) - His desire is restoration, not destruction.
    *   "The forbearance of God has been very great... But He will certainly arise to punish the wicked..." (PK 276.2) - Patience has a limit.
*   **Character Application**:
    *   **Problem**: We often tolerate sin in ourselves and society, becoming desensitized to its destructive nature.
    *   **Solution**: Understanding God's grief over sin should cultivate in us a hatred for evil because it hurts God and others.
    *   **Implementation**: Pray for God's perspective on sin. When confronted with evil, respond not just with anger, but with grief and a desire for righteousness, reflecting God's heart. This builds a character that values holiness.

### Monday: God Is Slow to Anger (Approx. 6 minutes)

*   **Central Point**: God's essential nature is gracious and merciful; His anger is a reaction to persistent evil, not His default state. He is patient ("long of nose").
*   **Biblical Foundation**:
    *   **Jonah 4:1-4**: Jonah is angry because God showed mercy to Nineveh.
        *   (v. 2) Jonah explicitly states *why* he fled: "for I knew that You are a gracious and merciful God, slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, One who relents from doing harm." Jonah understood God's character of mercy!
    *   **Matthew 10:8**: "Freely you have received, freely give." A principle Jonah struggled with.
    *   **Romans 3:25-26**: God demonstrates His righteousness by being both "just and the justifier" through Christ. His mercy doesn't compromise His justice.
*   **Ellen G. White Insights**:
    *   "When Jonah learned of God's purpose to spare the city... he should have been the first to rejoice... but instead he allowed his mind to dwell upon the possibility of his being regarded as a false prophet. Jealous of his reputation, he lost sight of the infinitely greater value of the souls in that wretched city." (PK 271.1)
    *   "Divine love makes its most touching appeals to the heart when it calls upon us to manifest the same tender compassion that Christ manifested... The true Christian will not willingly permit the soul in peril and need to go unwarned, uncared for." (AA 550.2-3)
*   **Character Application**:
    *   **Problem**: We can be quick to anger, hold grudges, and fail to show mercy, like Jonah.
    *   **Solution**: Remembering the immense, unmerited grace God has shown us should motivate us to be patient and gracious with others.
    *   **Implementation**: When wronged, pause and recall God's patience with your own failings. Ask God for strength to extend grace. How can we show mercy without condoning sin or enabling abuse? (Requires wisdom, setting boundaries while maintaining a forgiving spirit). This cultivates a merciful character like Christ's.

### Tuesday: Righteous Indignation [*] (Approx. 5 minutes)

*   **Central Point**: There is a form of anger – righteous indignation – that is not sinful but is a love-motivated response to injustice, hypocrisy, and dishonor to God, as demonstrated by Christ.
*   **Biblical Foundation**:
    *   **Matthew 21:12-13; John 2:14-16**: Jesus cleanses the temple. This wasn't uncontrolled rage, but "zeal" for God's house, anger against exploitation ("den of robbers") and desecration of sacred space meant for prayer and salvation.
    *   **Mark 10:13-14**: Jesus was "greatly displeased" (indignant) when disciples hindered children. His love for the little ones fueled this reaction.
    *   **Mark 3:4-5**: Jesus looked at the Pharisees "with anger, being grieved by the hardness of their hearts" before healing on the Sabbath. Anger mixed with grief, directed at willful opposition to God's goodness.
*   **Ellen G. White Insights**:
    *   "With a lofty zeal, and a severity he had never before manifested, he overthrew the tables..." Yet, "After the temple was cleansed, the demeanor of Jesus changed; the terrible majesty... gave place to an expression of tenderest sympathy." (2SP 118.2, 119.1) - Severity against sin, compassion for sinners.
    *   "It is true there is an indignation that is justifiable, even in the followers of Christ. When they see that God is dishonored... a righteous indignation stirs the soul. Such anger, born of sensitive morals, is not a sin. But those who at any supposed provocation feel at liberty to indulge anger or resentment are opening the heart to Satan." (DA 310.3)
*   **Character Application**:
    *   **Problem**: It's easy to confuse selfish anger (pride, irritation, personal offense) with righteous indignation.
    *   **Solution**: Examine the root of our anger. Is it truly about God's honor and injustice against others, motivated by love? Or is it about self?
    *   **Implementation**: Pray for discernment. Channel righteous anger constructively – speaking against injustice, defending the vulnerable, promoting righteousness – while guarding against bitterness and personal animosity. This develops a character sensitive to sin yet controlled by the Spirit.

### Wednesday: God Does Not Afflict Willingly [*] (Approx. 4 minutes)

*   **Central Point**: God does not desire to bring judgment or suffering; it is a consequence He permits or enacts reluctantly ("not from His heart") when sin and rebellion leave no other recourse consistent with His love and justice.
*   **Biblical Foundation**:
    *   **Lamentations 3:32-33**: "Though He causes grief, yet He will show compassion... For He does not afflict willingly [lit. 'from His heart'], Nor grieve the children of men."
    *   **Ezra 5:12; 2 Chronicles 36:16**: God "gave" Israel into Babylon's hand because they mocked His messengers and despised His words until "there was no remedy." Judgment was the last resort.
    *   **Jeremiah 51:24, 25, 44**: God later judges Babylon for its excessive cruelty, showing His justice extends even to the instruments He uses.
    *   **Judges 2:13-14; Psalm 106:41-42**: Examples of God "giving" His people over to the consequences of their choices (idolatry leading to oppression).
*   **Ellen G. White Insights**:
    *   "In the lamentation of Christ the very heart of God is pouring itself forth." (LHU 337.3) - His grief over Jerusalem's rejection.
    *   "Our heavenly Father doth not willingly afflict and grieve the children of men... The fire of the furnace is to kindle till our dross is consumed..." (HP 272.2-3) - Trials have a purifying purpose.
    *   "Severer and yet more severe chastisements were to be inflicted upon the rebellious nation, until at last the entire land was to become a desolation... the kingdom of Judah was to fall, never again to occupy its former position..." (PK 422.4) - A consequence of persistent rebellion after ample warning.
*   **Character Application**:
    *   **Problem**: We might view God's judgments as harsh or arbitrary.
    *   **Solution**: Understanding God's reluctance helps us trust His justice and love, even when facing difficult consequences or observing judgments.
    *   **Implementation**: Cultivate patience and long-suffering towards others, mirroring God's character. When facing trials, look for the refining purpose rather than seeing it merely as punishment. Trust that God's ultimate aim is restoration and the final good of the universe.

### Thursday: Show Compassion (Approx. 6 minutes)

*   **Central Point**: Because God reserves ultimate judgment for Himself and has provided salvation from wrath through Christ, His followers are called to show compassion and forgiveness, leaving vengeance to Him.
*   **Biblical Foundation**:
    *   **Deuteronomy 32:35; Romans 12:17-21; Hebrews 10:30**: "Vengeance is Mine, I will repay," says the Lord. We are explicitly told *not* to take our own revenge, but to overcome evil with good.
    *   **1 Thessalonians 1:10**: Jesus "delivers us from the wrath to come."
    *   **1 Thessalonians 5:9**: "For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ."
    *   **Romans 5:8-9**: While we were sinners, Christ died for us, saving us from wrath through Him.
*   **Ellen G. White Insights**:
    *   "We should have no misgivings in regard to the perfect sinlessness of the human nature of Christ... This holy Substitute is able to save to the uttermost..." (1SM 256.1-2) - Our salvation is secure in Him.
    *   "Jesus could make no mistake; but human judgment is erring, and may be wrong... Men may misjudge motives... when they think they are doing right to reprove wrong, they may go too far..." (ST, March 3, 1887, 'Love the Fulfilling of the Law').
    *   "Our God is gracious, of tender pity, and plenteous in mercy. He knows our weaknesses and needs, and he will help our infirmities if we will only trust in him." (ST, March 3, 1887).
*   **Character Application**:
    *   **Problem**: Our natural inclination is often to retaliate, judge, or condemn others when wronged.
    *   **Solution**: Recognizing the magnitude of God's grace towards us through Christ, who bore the wrath we deserved, should humble us and empower us to show compassion and forgiveness.
    *   **Implementation**: Practice Romans 12: "Bless those who persecute you," "live peaceably with all men," "do not avenge yourselves." When tempted to judge, remember 1 Corinthians 4:5 ("judge nothing before the time"). Entrust justice to God and focus on reflecting His mercy. This builds a character marked by grace.

### Conclusion (Approx. 7 minutes)

*   **Summary**: God's wrath is not capricious anger but the necessary, righteous, and love-driven response of a holy God to the destructive reality of sin. It is characterized by grief (Sun), slowness (Mon), righteousness (Tue), reluctance (Wed), and is ultimately superseded by His offer of salvation through Christ, calling us to compassion (Thu).
*   **Character Goal**: Understanding God's wrath correctly is crucial for character development. It helps us:
    *   Hate sin as God hates it – because it destroys.
    *   Cultivate God's patience and compassion.
    *   Distinguish righteous concern from selfish anger.
    *   Trust God's ultimate justice and leave vengeance to Him.
    *   Appreciate the depth of Christ's sacrifice, which delivers us from wrath.
    This is part of the restoration of God's image in us – reflecting both His justice and His mercy.
*   **Final Appeal & Urgency**:
    *   **Personal Reflection**: Do our reactions to sin and injustice mirror Christ's – grieved, righteously indignant yet compassionate – or are they rooted in pride and impatience? Are we quick to extend the mercy we have freely received?
    *   **Living it Out**: Let us actively practice forbearance and forgiveness, trusting God with outcomes. Let our lives demonstrate the compassion that flows from understanding God's character.
    *   **The Great Controversy Context**: God's patience, while vast, is not infinite. Judgment against unrepentant sin is certain. We live in the closing scenes of earth's history. Understanding God's wrath underscores the urgency of accepting Christ's salvation and sharing this hope with others before probation closes.
*   **Closing Thought**: "Love no less than justice demanded that for this sin judgment should be inflicted.... It was the mercy of God that thousands should suffer, to prevent the necessity of visiting judgments upon millions. In order to save the many, He must punish the few." (PP 324, 325). God's actions, even in judgment, are ultimately driven by love and mercy on a universal scale. Let us seek to understand and reflect this divine character as we await His soon return.
*   **Prayer**: Pray for wisdom to understand God's character more deeply, for grace to hate sin as He does, and for strength to show His compassion and patience to others, reflecting His image more fully.
