## The Wrath of Divine Love

**Overarching Theme:** God's Holy Character Confronts Sin: Understanding Divine Justice and Mercy as Catalysts for Our Sanctification
**Central Focus:** To grasp that God's righteous response to sin (His holy "wrath") originates from His perfect love and unchanging holiness, motivating us toward deeper repentance, reliance on Christ's sacrifice, and the urgent pursuit of a Christlike character fit for eternity.
**Key Texts:** Psalm 78:38; Romans 3:25-26; Hebrews 12:29; Mark 3:5

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

**I. Introduction (5-7 mins)**
    *   Hook: "How can a God of perfect love also express wrath? Many struggle with this. Today, we'll explore how these are not opposites, but flow from the very holiness of God's character."
    *   Theme Introduction: State the profound theme: God's Holy Character Confronts Sin. Explain why understanding this depth is vital for our spiritual lives, especially now.
        *   *(Whiteboard: Write Main Theme Title: God's Holy Character Confronts Sin)*
    *   Connection to Character/Eternity: This isn't just theology; it's about transformation. Understanding God's view of sin shapes our character, preparing us to stand in His presence. Our eternal destiny is linked to reflecting His holiness.
    *   Roadmap: Briefly outline: 1. God's Unchanging Holiness (Love & Justice), 2. Righteous Indignation (Love's Response to Evil), 3. The Cross (Justice & Mercy Meet), 4. Our Response (Embracing Sanctification).

**II. The Unchanging Holiness of God: Foundation of Love & Justice (10 mins)**
    *   **A. God's Nature: Perfect Love AND Perfect Justice:**
        *   Core Teaching Point: God's fundamental nature is HOLINESS – absolute purity, love, and righteousness. His love necessitates justice against sin, which destroys what He loves. They are inseparable facets of His perfect character.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Habakkuk 1:13 ("Your eyes are too pure to look on evil"); 1 John 4:8 ("God is love"); Psalm 89:14 ("Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne"). God cannot ignore sin because His very nature opposes it.
        *   EGW Insight: "The Old and the New Testament are inseparable, for both are the teachings of Christ." (5BC 1094.4) – His character is consistent.

    *   **B. Grief & Longsuffering in the Face of Rebellion:** [*]
        *   Core Teaching Point: Psalm 78 illustrates God's deep grief over His people's persistent sin, His longsuffering patience, and His compassionate restraint ("turned His anger away"). Yet, consequences inevitably followed rebellion, demonstrating that His patience doesn't nullify His justice.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Psalm 78:38-41 – Note the cycle: sin, consequence, cry for help, deliverance, forgetting/sinning again. God "remembered that they were but flesh" (v. 39).
        *   EGW Insight: "But He, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned He His anger away.... For He remembered that they were but flesh..." (PP 410.3, quoting Ps 78:38-39). His compassion is vast, but sin still grieves Him deeply.
        *   Application/Problem Tackled: We often presume upon God's mercy, forgetting the offense sin causes to His holy nature. Understanding His grief should lead us to hate sin as He does.

    *   ***Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1):***
        *   *Analogy:* A loving parent is deeply grieved, not just angry, when their child repeatedly chooses self-destructive behavior. Their warnings and discipline stem from love, desiring the child's well-being.
        *   *Metaphor:* God's holiness is like pure, intense light. Sin is like darkness – it simply cannot coexist in His presence without consequence.

    *   ***Whiteboard Visuals:***
        *   *Keyword:* HOLINESS = LOVE + JUSTICE
        *   *Diagram:* Psalm 78 Cycle: Rebel -> Consequence -> Cry -> Deliver -> Rebel -> God's Grief/Compassion
        *   *Verse:* Ps 89:14 / Hab 1:13
        *   *Quote Snippet:* "...many a time turned He His anger away." (Ps 78:38)

    *   ***Discussion Questions (Allow brief time):***
        *   *(Simple/Observation):* "In Psalm 78, what words show God's compassion despite Israel's repeated failures?"
        *   *(Reflection):* "Why is it important to remember that God's love *and* His justice are both parts of His perfect holiness?"
        *   *(Application):* "How does realizing sin genuinely *grieves* our loving Father change how we might view our own 'small' sins?"

**III. Righteous Indignation: Love's Holy Response to Evil (10 mins)**
    *   **A. Defining Divine "Wrath": Holy Opposition to Sin:**
        *   Core Teaching Point: Biblical "wrath" isn't uncontrolled human rage. It's God's settled, righteous, necessary opposition to sin and its devastating effects. It stems from His love for His creation and His desire for righteousness. It's His justice in action.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Mark 3:5 – Jesus looked with *anger*, yet was *grieved* by hardness of heart. His anger was tied to compassion and a desire for healing/good. Compare Temple Cleansing (Matt 21:12-13) – zeal for His Father's house, indignation against exploitation.
        *   EGW Insight: "Christ's indignation was directed against the hypocrisy, the gross sins, by which men were destroying their own souls... He had a holy wrath against the prince of darkness; but He manifested no irritated temper." (LHU 337.1). It was principled, not personal pique.
        *   Application/Problem Tackled: We mistake God's wrath for vindictiveness. Seeing it as righteous indignation helps us understand His character and the seriousness of sin.

    *   **B. The Great Controversy Context:** [*]
        *   Core Teaching Point: God's response to sin is also part of vindicating His own character before the universe. Satan accuses God of being unjustly restrictive or unlovingly harsh. God's dealings with sin ultimately prove His perfect justice and love.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Revelation 12:10 (Accuser); Romans 3:4 ("That You may be found just when You speak, And blameless when You judge.")
        *   Application/Obstacles to Depth: We focus only on our personal salvation, forgetting the cosmic implications of sin and God's response.

    *   ***Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2):***
        *   *Analogy:* A just judge must sentence a guilty criminal according to the law, not out of personal anger, but out of duty to uphold justice and protect society. God's wrath upholds universal moral law.
        *   *Metaphor:* Like a skilled surgeon removing a deadly cancer. The process is painful (judgment), but necessary for life and health (restoration), motivated by a desire to heal.

    *   ***Whiteboard Visuals:***
        *   *Keyword:* RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION (Not Human Anger)
        *   *Diagram:* Mark 3:5 = Anger (vs Sin) + Grief (vs Hardness) -> Action (Healing)
        *   *Verse:* Mark 3:5 / Matt 21:13 ("den of robbers")
        *   *Concept:* Great Controversy / Vindicating God's Character

    *   ***Discussion Questions (Allow brief time):***
        *   *(Simple/Recall):* "In Mark 3, what two emotions did Jesus feel simultaneously when confronting the Pharisees?" (Anger and grief)
        *   *(Reflection):* "How does understanding God's 'wrath' as 'righteous indignation' against evil change your perception of God?"
        *   *(Application):* "How can Christ's example of righteous anger guide us when we encounter injustice or sin, preventing us from falling into sinful anger?" (See DA 310.3 - sensitive morals, not resentment).

**IV. The Cross: Where Infinite Justice and Boundless Mercy Meet (10 mins)** [*]
    *   **A. Atonement: Satisfying Justice, Demonstrating Love:**
        *   Core Teaching Point: The Cross is the ultimate demonstration of God's holy character. Here, His absolute justice against sin was fully satisfied as Christ bore its penalty. Simultaneously, His infinite love and mercy provided a way of salvation for repentant sinners.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Romans 3:25-26 – God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement... to demonstrate His justice... so as to be *just* and the *one who justifies* those who have faith in Jesus. This is the heart of the Gospel!
        *   EGW Insight: "Divine wrath would have come upon Christ as it came upon Adam. Christ and the church would have been without hope." (1SM 256.1) - But Christ bore it for us. He is our "holy Substitute" (1SM 256.2).
        *   Application/Character Trait Focus: Understanding the cost of sin (met by justice) and the depth of grace (offered by mercy) cultivates profound humility, gratitude, and love for God.

    *   **B. God Does Not Afflict Willingly:**
        *   Core Teaching Point: God takes no pleasure in judgment (Lam 3:33). He warns, pleads, and offers mercy repeatedly. Judgment comes only when His forbearance is exhausted and sin must be dealt with for the good of the universe and often, in mercy to prevent wider ruin.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Lamentations 3:32-33 ("He does not afflict willingly"); Ezekiel 33:11 ("I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked"); 2 Peter 3:9 ("not willing that any should perish").
        *   EGW Insight: "God allows men a period of probation; but there is a point beyond which divine patience is exhausted, and the judgments of God are sure to follow." (PK 276.2). He gives nations over only when there is "no remedy" (PK 422.5, citing 2 Chron 36:16).
        *   Application/End-Time Relevance: God's longsuffering gives us space for repentance, but it will end. This adds urgency to our need for sanctification and readiness.

    *   ***Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2):***
        *   *Analogy:* A king must uphold his own law against treason. But out of love, he pays the traitor's immense penalty himself, satisfying justice while offering pardon. That's the Cross.
        *   *Metaphor:* Christ on the cross was like a divine lightning rod, absorbing the full, righteous energy of God's justice against sin, protecting us from its destructive force.

    *   ***Whiteboard Visuals:***
        *   *Keyword:* ATONEMENT / CROSS
        *   *Diagram:* CROSS = JUSTICE (Satisfied) + MERCY (Extended)
        *   *Verse:* Rom 3:26 ("Just and Justifier") / Lam 3:33 ("Not willingly")
        *   *Quote Snippet:* "...to be just and the one who justifies..."

    *   ***Discussion Questions (Allow brief time):***
        *   *(Simple/Observation):* "According to Romans 3:26, what two things does the Cross allow God to be simultaneously?" (Just and the Justifier)
        *   *(Reflection):* "How does the Cross demonstrate both the terrible reality of God's justice against sin AND the incredible depth of His love?"
        *   *(Application):* "Knowing God doesn't afflict willingly (Lam 3:33), how should we respond to His patience and warnings in our own lives and in the world?"

**V. Our Response: Embracing Sanctification & Reflecting His Character (5-8 mins)**
    *   Summary: We've seen God's holiness demands a response to sin (justice/wrath), but His love provides a remedy through Christ (mercy/atonement). His character is perfectly consistent.
    *   Character Focus Recap: The goal is not just escaping wrath, but becoming like Christ – reflecting His holy character through His power (sanctification). This is the evidence of true conversion and readiness for His kingdom.
        *   *(Whiteboard: Key Character Trait: HOLINESS / CHRISTLIKENESS)*
    *   Call to Action/Decision: How does this deep understanding change us?
        1.  **Hate Sin:** See sin as God sees it – a violation of His holy love, grieving Him.
        2.  **Cling to Christ:** Rely wholly on His atoning sacrifice for justification.
        3.  **Pursue Holiness:** Cooperate daily with the Holy Spirit for sanctification (character perfection). "I die daily." (ST, March 3, 1887.12).
        4.  **Show Compassion, Not Vengeance:** Reflect God's mercy. Leave judgment to Him (Rom 12:19). Be "slow to anger" (Jonah 4:2).
        *   *(Whiteboard: Call to Action Keywords: REPENT / TRUST / OBEY / REFLECT)*
        *   *(Optional Final Question):* "Considering God's holy character and His mercy at the Cross, what one aspect of your character will you surrender to Him for transformation this week?" (Lead into prayer)
    *   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: "The forbearance of God has been very great... But He will certainly arise to punish the wicked..." (PK 276.2). Yet, "Our God is gracious, of tender pity, and plenteous in mercy... He will help our infirmities if we will only trust in him." (ST, March 3, 1887.13). Let us respond to His love and prepare for His soon return!
        *   *(Whiteboard: Final Verse Ref or Hope phrase: Heb 12:29 / Rev 22:12 / "Be Ye Holy")*
