## Free Will, Love, and Divine Providence
- **Overarching Themes**: God's Sovereignty, Human Free Will, The Nature of Love, God's Providence in a World of Sin, Hope in Christ.
- **Character Goal**: To cultivate deeper trust in God's overarching plan and wisdom, even when His ideal will is thwarted by human choices, and to inspire responsible use of our God-given freedom in alignment with His loving character.

**(Time Allocation: 45 Minutes)**

**I. Introduction: Providence, Sovereignty, and the Dilemma (6 minutes)**
    *   **Objective**: Define key terms and introduce the central tension between God's power and human freedom, setting the stage for the lesson's exploration.
    *   **Define Providence**: God's active guidance and care over His creation. How we view this shapes our entire relationship with Him (Lesson Intro).
    *   **Define Sovereignty**: God's supreme authority and power. Some misunderstand this to mean God *micromanages* or *determines* every event, including sin and suffering (Sunday's intro anecdote).
        *   This view creates deep problems, especially regarding evil (Sunday). If God *wills* everything, He wills suffering and sin. This contradicts His character revealed in Scripture.
    *   **The Core Question**: How do we reconcile God's sovereignty and power with the reality of human free will, sin, suffering, and God's revealed character of love?
    *   **Memory Text**: John 16:33 (NKJV) - "These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world." - This text provides the ultimate answer: peace and hope are found *in Christ*, who navigated this tension perfectly and overcame.
    *   **EGW**: "The dealings of God with His people should be often repeated... We need often to recount God's goodness and to praise Him for His wonderful works." (6T 364.1) - Understanding His providence, even amidst difficulties, is vital.

**II. God's Unfulfilled Desires: The Reality of Free Will (10 minutes)**
    *   **Objective**: Establish from Scripture that God's *ideal* will is often rejected by human choices, demonstrating the reality of free will.
    *   **Central Point**: God's sovereignty does not mean His desires are always fulfilled in the actions of His creatures. He permits choices contrary to His perfect will.
    *   **Biblical Foundation**:
        *   **Psalm 81:11-14 (NKJV)**: "But My people would not heed My voice, And Israel would have none of Me. So I gave them over to their own stubborn heart, To walk in their own counsels. Oh, that My people would listen to Me, That Israel would walk in My ways! I would soon subdue their enemies..."
            *   God laments Israel's choice. He desired obedience and blessing for them, but they chose rebellion. He *allowed* their choice ("gave them over").
        *   **Isaiah 30:15, 18 (NKJV)**: "For thus says the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel: 'In returning and rest you shall be saved; In quietness and confidence shall be your strength.' But you would not... Therefore the LORD will wait, that He may be gracious to you..."
            *   God offered salvation and strength through trust, but they refused ("you would not"). His desire was rejected.
        *   **Isaiah 66:4 (NKJV)**: "So will I choose their delusions, And bring their fears on them; Because, when I called, no one answered, When I spoke they did not hear; But they did evil before My eyes, And chose that in which I do not delight."
            *   God acknowledges they *chose* what He did *not* delight in. The consequences followed their choices.
        *   **Luke 13:34 (NKJV)**: "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, but you were not willing!"
            *   Jesus expresses deep sorrow over Jerusalem's rejection of His love and protection. His desire ("I wanted") was met with their unwillingness ("you were not willing").
    *   **EGW**: "In the face of the most positive commands of God, [many] men and women will follow their own inclinations... The Lord is not pleased with such prayers... But God will not be trifled with. He will permit such persons to follow the desires of their own hearts." (3T 72.3-73.1)
    *   **Character Connection**: Recognizing that our choices can genuinely grieve God and reject His best plans should lead us to value His will and seek alignment with it, not out of fear, but out of love and appreciation for His desires for us.

**III. Pantokrator: All-Powerful, Not All-Determining [*] (8 minutes)**
    *   **Objective**: Explain the meaning of God's omnipotence (Pantokrator) and its inherent limitations based on His character and the nature of reality (e.g., logical contradictions, free will).
    *   **Central Point**: God's power is absolute ("all-powerful"), but He cannot act contrary to His own nature (love, truth, justice) or perform logical contradictions. Granting free will inherently limits His *control* over creaturely choices, though not His ultimate *power* or *purpose*.
    *   **Biblical Foundation**:
        *   **Revelation 11:17; 1:8; etc.** - God is the "LORD God Almighty" (Pantokrator - "all-powerful").
        *   **Jeremiah 32:17**: "Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm. There is nothing too hard for You."
        *   **Luke 1:37**: "For with God nothing will be impossible."
        *   **Matthew 19:26**: "With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
        *   **Hebrews 1:3**: He upholds "all things by the word of His power."
    *   **Limitations Based on God's Nature**:
        *   **2 Timothy 2:13 (NKJV)**: "If we are faithless, He remains faithful; He cannot deny Himself." God cannot act against His own faithful character.
        *   **Titus 1:2**: "...God, who cannot lie..."
        *   **Hebrews 6:18**: "...it is impossible for God to lie..."
    *   **Limitation Based on Logical Possibility**:
        *   **Matthew 26:39 (NKJV)**: "O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will." It was *not possible* for God to save sinners *and* spare Christ the cross simultaneously. One path had to be chosen consistent with His plan and justice.
    *   **Limitation Based on Granted Freedom**:
        *   **1 Timothy 2:4**: God "desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth."
        *   **2 Peter 3:9**: The Lord is "...not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance."
        *   **Ezekiel 33:11**: "'As I live,' says the Lord GOD, 'I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live.'"
        *   *Yet*, not all are saved. Why? Because God honors the free will He granted. He *can* powerfully persuade, draw, and convict, but He does not *force* salvation.
    *   **EGW**: "The Lord does not save sinners by abrogating his law... God cannot dispense with his law... in order to pardon sin. The justice, the moral excellence, of the law must be maintained..." (RH, Nov 15, 1898). His power operates within the framework of His righteous character and law.

**IV. To Love God: The Necessity of Freedom [*] (7 minutes)**
    *   **Objective**: Demonstrate that genuine love, the highest principle of God's government, requires freedom.
    *   **Central Point**: Love cannot be coerced. God desires a relationship based on freely chosen love, which necessitates granting genuine free will, even with its inherent risks.
    *   **Biblical Foundation**:
        *   **Matthew 22:37 (NKJV)**: "Jesus said to him, ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’" - This is the *greatest commandment*, implying it is God's highest desire for us.
        *   **Deuteronomy 6:4-5 (NKJV)**: "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one! You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength." - The foundation of Israel's covenant relationship.
        *   **Why doesn't God *make* everyone love Him?** Because forced "love" is a contradiction in terms. It wouldn't be genuine.
    *   **God's Faithfulness Limits His Actions**:
        *   **Hebrews 6:17-18**: God confirmed His promise with an oath, showing His commitment. If He promises freedom, He upholds it.
        *   **Numbers 23:19**: "God is not a man, that He should lie..."
    *   **The Cost of Freedom**: God knew the risk. He knew granting freedom could lead to sin and rebellion.
        *   **EGW**: "From the beginning, God and Christ knew of the apostasy of Satan, and of the fall of man through the deceptive power of the apostate. God did not ordain that sin should exist, but He foresaw its existence, and made provision to meet the terrible emergency." (DA 22.2)
        *   **Discussion Question 2 Insight**: Love was so fundamental that God deemed creating beings capable of love (which requires freedom) worth the cost, even knowing it would lead to the cross.
    *   **Character Connection**: Understanding that God values our free choice to love Him should motivate us to respond with genuine affection and obedience, recognizing the immense value He places on a relationship not based on compulsion but on willing devotion. Reflect on choices where you knew God's will but chose otherwise – this highlights the reality and sobering responsibility of free will (Tuesday).

**V. God's Ideal vs. Remedial Will: Providence in Action (7 minutes)**
    *   **Objective**: Introduce the concepts of God's ideal and remedial wills to explain how God works His ultimate purposes even when His preferred path is rejected.
    *   **Central Point**: God has an *ideal* will (what He desires in a perfect world), but He also has a *remedial* will (His plan that accounts for and works through the free, often sinful, choices of His creatures) to bring about the best possible outcome under the circumstances.
    *   **Biblical Foundation**:
        *   **Ephesians 1:9-11 (NKJV)**: "...having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself... In Him also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will..."
            *   **Predestination (prohorizo)**: Means "to decide beforehand." It refers to God's *plan* and *purpose*, established with foreknowledge of creaturely choices, not an arbitrary determination of individual fates irrespective of their choices. God's plan *incorporates* our choices. (See Rom 8:29 - "whom He foreknew, He also predestined...")
            *   **"Works all things according to the counsel of His will"**: This refers to God's *remedial* will – His overarching plan that takes *all* factors (including rebellion and sin) into account and guides history towards His ultimate good purpose. It doesn't mean every event *is* His ideal desire (as seen in Section II).
        *   **Romans 8:28 (CEB)**: "We know that God works all things together for good for the ones who love God, for those who are called according to his purpose." - This is the essence of God's remedial providence. Even amidst suffering and evil resulting from wrong choices (ours or others'), God can weave events together for the ultimate good of those who love Him.
    *   **Analogy**: The Baking Competition (Thursday) - God provides essential ingredients (His laws, grace, opportunities), but humans add their own (choices, rebellion, sin). God, in His wisdom (remedial will), still works with the resulting "cake" (history) to achieve His ultimate purpose of redemption and restoration.
    *   **EGW**: "God does not prevent the plottings of wicked men, but He causes their devices to work for good to those who in trial and conflict maintain their faith and loyalty... Thus God brings His children near to Him, that He may show them their weakness and His strength." (AA 574.2)
    *   **Character Connection**: This understanding brings immense comfort. Even when things go wrong, when sin mars the world, when we suffer, God hasn't lost control. His remedial plan is still active, working towards ultimate good. This fosters trust and resilience.

**VI. Conclusion: Hope in the Overcomer (7 minutes)**
    *   **Objective**: Reinforce the hope found in Christ's victory over sin and the world, encouraging trust and compassionate action amidst ongoing trials.
    *   **Recap**: God is sovereign and all-powerful, but His love led Him to grant us free will. This freedom allows for choices contrary to His ideal will, leading to sin and suffering. However, God's providence (His remedial will) works through even these tragedies, guided by His foreknowledge and ultimate purpose.
    *   **The Problem of Suffering**: Jesus didn't promise a life free from trials (John 16:33a - "In the world you will have tribulation"). Suffering is a reality in this world marred by sin, often stemming from the misuse of free will. It's not God's ideal, but a consequence He permits and works through.
        *   **God Suffers Too**: Recognize that God Himself laments and is grieved by suffering and evil (Friday, Discussion Question 3). This deepens our understanding of His love and the cost of sin.
    *   **The Ultimate Hope**: John 16:33b - "...but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world."
        *   Christ lived within the tension of divine purpose and human opposition. He faced suffering caused by others' choices. Yet, He remained faithful and victorious.
        *   His victory guarantees the ultimate triumph of God's plan. Evil will end. God's ideal will *will* eventually be fully realized in the new earth.
    *   **Our Response**:
        *   **Trust**: Even when things don't make sense, trust God's remedial providence (Rom 8:28). (LHU 299 - "cannot you trust me?")
        *   **Faith**: Cling to Christ, our Overcomer. Faith is the victory (1 John 5:4). (TMK 166)
        *   **Character Development**: Allow trials, understood in this context, to draw us closer to God, develop patience, and foster compassion for others (Thursday). (7T 44 - Consecrate each day).
        *   **Responsibility**: Use our freedom wisely, seeking to align our choices with God's loving will.
    *   **Final Appeal**: Embrace the peace Christ offers (John 16:33). Despite the tribulations inherent in a world exercising free will against God, our hope is secure in the One who has already overcome. Let this understanding shape us into characters reflecting His love, trust, and resilience.
