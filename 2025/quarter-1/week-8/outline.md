**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

**I. Introduction (5-7 mins)**
    *   Hook: "If God is all-powerful and all-loving, why does He allow suffering? Why doesn't He just *make* everyone obey and be saved?" This question lies at the heart of the Great Controversy.
    *   Theme Introduction: State the profound theme: God's loving sovereignty operates alongside our sacred free will. Understanding this tension is vital for navigating life and the Great Controversy.
        *   *(Whiteboard: Write Main Theme Title: God's Love, Our Choice, His Purpose)*
    *   Connection to Character/Eternity: This isn't just theology; it's about becoming the people God needs in these last days—people who choose Him freely, reflect His character perfectly, and trust Him amidst confusion. Our eternal destiny hinges on understanding and responding correctly.
    *   Roadmap: We'll explore: 1) God's true power and His self-imposed limits out of love. 2) How He works providentially despite our choices. 3) How we can overcome through Him, even in tribulation.

**II. God's Sovereign Love & Our Sacred Freedom (12-15 mins)**
    *   **A. The Almighty Who Respects Choice:**
        *   Core Teaching Point: God is *Pantokrator*, All-Powerful (Rev 11:17, Jer 32:17), BUT His power operates within the bounds of His character – love and justice. True love *cannot* be forced (Matt 22:37).
        *   Biblical Foundation: Deut 30:19 ("I have set before you life and death... therefore choose life"); God *cannot* lie (Titus 1:2); God *cannot* deny Himself (2 Tim 2:13). He limits the exercise of His raw power to honor the freedom necessary for love.
        *   EGW Insight: "The Lord will not compel men to deal justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with their God; He sets before the human agent good and evil... Christ invites us, saying, 'Follow Me.' But we are never forced to walk in His footsteps. If we do walk in His footsteps, it is the result of deliberate choice." (CS 138).
        *   Application/Problem Tackled: Addresses the misconception that God micromanages or forces every event. Clarifies that choosing against God is a real possibility with real consequences.

    *   **B. The Limits Defined by Love:** [*]
        *   Core Teaching Point: God *wants* all to be saved (1 Tim 2:4), but His commitment to free will means He won't override our choice, even if it leads to loss. His desire is often unfulfilled by human rebellion (Ps 81:11, 13).
        *   Biblical Foundation: Luke 13:34 (Jesus laments over Jerusalem's refusal); Matt 26:39 (Christ's prayer acknowledges God's power but submits to the necessary plan involving suffering, not forced prevention).
        *   EGW Insight: "But God will not be trifled with. He will permit such persons to follow the desires of their own hearts... 'So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels.'" (T3 72-73, quoting Ps 81:11-12).
        *   Application/Obstacles to Depth: Overcoming the simplistic view that "everything happens for a reason" means God *directly willed* the bad things. Understanding God's grief over sin.

    *   ***Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2):***
        *   *Analogy:* A loving parent desires their child's love and obedience, but knows true love must be freely given, not programmed like a robot. Forcing it would destroy the relationship.
        *   *Hypothetical:* Imagine trying to *force* someone to genuinely love you. The very act of coercion makes authentic love impossible. God faces this divine dilemma.

    *   ***Whiteboard Visuals:***
        *   *Keyword:* SOVEREIGNTY / LOVE / FREE WILL
        *   *Diagram:* Heart (Love) -> Hand Open (Choice) -> Path Diverging (Consequences)
        *   *Verse:* Deut 30:19 / Titus 1:2
        *   *Quote Snippet:* "...never forced..." (CS 138)

    *   ***Discussion Questions (Allow brief time):***
        *   *(Simple/Observation):* "In Psalm 81, what does God say He *wished* His people would do?"
        *   *(Reflection):* "Why is the concept of *forced* love a contradiction in terms? How does this apply to our relationship with God?"
        *   *(Application):* "Knowing God respects our freedom so much, how should this affect the seriousness with which we make our daily choices?"

**III. God's Providence: Ideal vs. Remedial Will (10-12 mins)**
    *   **A. God's Perfect Plan & Our Detours:**
        *   Core Teaching Point: God has an *ideal* will – perfect harmony, no sin (His original plan). But He also has a *remedial* will – His plan that takes into account our foreseen free choices (including sin) and works *through* them towards His ultimate good purposes.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Eph 1:9-11 ("according to the counsel of His will") refers to this overarching remedial plan, not fatalistic predetermination. God foreknew, but did not ordain, sin.
        *   EGW Insight: "The plan for our redemption was not an afterthought... God did not ordain that sin should exist, but He foresaw its existence, and made provision to meet the terrible emergency." (DA 22).
        *   Application/Character Trait Focus: Develops trust that even when things go wrong (often due to human choices), God hasn't lost control and is still working. Fosters submission to His larger plan.

    *   **B. Working All Things for Good (Not Causing All Things):** [*]
        *   Core Teaching Point: Romans 8:28 ("all things work together for good") doesn't mean all things *are* good or that God *causes* evil. It means God, in His providence, can weave even the consequences of sin and suffering into His ultimate redemptive plan for those who love Him.
        *   Biblical Foundation: Genesis 50:20 (Joseph: "You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good"). God uses the results of evil choices for His purposes.
        *   EGW Insight: "God does not prevent the plottings of wicked men, but He causes their devices to work for good to those who in trial and conflict maintain their faith and loyalty." (AA 574).
        *   Application/End-Time Relevance: Crucial for facing end-time trials. We must trust God's remedial providence when circumstances seem chaotic or unjust, knowing He is still guiding history towards His victory.

    *   ***Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2):***
        *   *Visual Metaphor:* A master weaver incorporating dark threads (results of sin/suffering) into a beautiful tapestry, creating depth and contrast that highlights the golden threads (God's grace/purpose).
        *   *Analogy:* A GPS recalculating the route. You took a wrong turn (free choice), but the system (God's providence) finds a new way to get you to the destination (His ultimate purpose), though the journey might be longer or harder.

    *   ***Whiteboard Visuals:***
        *   *Keyword:* PROVIDENCE / IDEAL vs. REMEDIAL WILL
        *   *Diagram:* Straight Line (Ideal) -> Jagged Line (Actual Choices) -> Converging Line (God's Purpose)
        *   *Verse:* Rom 8:28 / Gen 50:20
        *   *Quote Snippet:* "...foresaw... made provision." (DA 22)

    *   ***Discussion Questions (Allow brief time):***
        *   *(Simple/Recall):* "What was the GPS analogy meant to illustrate about God's providence?"
        *   *(Reflection):* "How does distinguishing between God's ideal will and His remedial will help us reconcile God's goodness with the existence of evil?"
        *   *(Application):* "Think of a difficult situation (past or present). How might viewing it through the lens of God's *remedial* providence (working *despite* hardship) change your perspective or response?"

**IV. Overcoming the World Through Christ (8-10 mins)** [*]
    *   **A. Tribulation is Promised, Victory is Assured:**
        *   Core Teaching Point: Jesus explicitly told us, "In the world you will have tribulation" (John 16:33). Suffering isn't a sign of God's disapproval or absence, but an expected part of living in a world marred by sin, within the Great Controversy.
        *   Biblical Foundation: John 16:33b ("...but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world"). Our hope isn't in avoiding trials, but in Christ's victory *over* the world system and sin.
        *   EGW Insight: "Often we enter the furnace of affliction with our souls darkened with selfishness; but if patient under the crucial test, we shall come forth reflecting the divine character." (IHP 279). Trials are refining opportunities.
        *   Application/Problem Tackled: Counteracts the false "health and wealth" gospel. Helps believers maintain faith when facing hardship, seeing it as a refining process.

    *   **B. Faith: The Means of Overcoming:**
        *   Core Teaching Point: The victory isn't achieved by our strength, but by faith – clinging to Christ, trusting His promises, relying on His power, even when we don't understand His providence.
        *   Biblical Foundation: 1 John 5:4 ("This is the victory that overcomes the world—our faith"). Faith connects us to the Overcomer.
        *   EGW Insight: "It is that faith which... recognizing your helplessness, your utter inability to save yourself, takes hold of the helper who is mighty to save, as your only hope... 'Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world, and my divine strength is yours.'" (TMK 166).
        *   Application/Character Trait Focus: Develops dependence on God, perseverance, and hope rooted not in circumstances but in Christ's character and promises. Essential for the final generation.

    *   ***Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2):***
        *   *Metaphor:* Like climbing a treacherous mountain – the danger is real (tribulation), but clinging tightly to the experienced Guide (Christ) ensures you reach the summit (victory).
        *   *Analogy:* A soldier in battle faces enemy fire (tribulation), but finds courage and strength by trusting their Commander's strategy and power (Christ's overcoming victory).

    *   ***Whiteboard Visuals:***
        *   *Keyword:* TRIBULATION / OVERCOMING / FAITH
        *   *Diagram:* Cross (Christ's Victory) -> Shield (Faith) -> Fiery Darts (Tribulation)
        *   *Verse:* John 16:33 / 1 John 5:4
        *   *Question:* Whose Strength?

    *   ***Discussion Questions (Allow brief time):***
        *   *(Simple/Observation):* "According to John 16:33, what did Jesus say we *should* do despite facing tribulation?" (Be of good cheer).
        *   *(Reflection):* "How does faith act as 'the victory' (1 John 5:4)? What does faith actually *do* in the face of trials?"
        *   *(Application):* "What is one specific promise of God you can consciously choose to trust this week when facing a difficulty or temptation?"

**V. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)**
    *   Summary: God is sovereign, powerful, and infinitely loving. His love led Him to grant us sacred free will. Though sin entered, His providence guides history through His remedial will. We *will* face trials, but through faith in Christ, who has overcome, we too can overcome and be refined.
    *   Character Focus Recap: The ultimate goal is character perfection – reflecting Jesus fully. This requires understanding these truths and choosing daily, hourly, to trust and obey Him, cooperating with His refining work.
        *   *(Whiteboard: Key Character Trait: TRUST / FAITHFULNESS)*
    *   Call to Action/Decision: Choose today whom you will serve. Will you resent God for the trials allowed by freedom, or will you trust His loving providence? Will you surrender your will to His, allowing Him to refine your character for His kingdom? Make a conscious decision to trust His heart, even when you can't trace His hand.
        *   *(Whiteboard: Call to Action Keyword: CHOOSE / TRUST / SURRENDER)*
        *   *(Optional Final Question):* "What one aspect of God's character revealed today encourages you most to trust Him more fully?" (Rhetorical, leading into prayer)
    *   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: "Each morning consecrate yourselves... Lay all your plans before God, to be carried out or given up, as His providence shall indicate... Thus the life will be molded more and more after the divine example; 'and the peace of God... shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.'" (T7 44, paraphrased). He is coming soon! Let us be found ready, trusting Him completely.
        *   *(Whiteboard: Final Verse Ref or Hope phrase: Phil 4:7 / "He Is Faithful!")*
